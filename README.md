# August 24th, 2022

## Agenda
- Initial planning for Kona.
- [P2626R0: charN_t incremental adoption: Casting pointers of UTF character types](https://wg21.link/p2626r0).

## Meeting summary
- Attendees:
  - Corentin Jabot
  - Hubert Tong
  - Jens Maurer
  - Mark de Wever
  - Peter Brett
  - Steve Downey
  - Tom Honermann
  - Victor Zverovich
- Initial planning for Kona.
  - Tom stated that there will likely be NB comments for SG16 to address and that they are
    unlikely to be available in a timeframe that would allow us to discuss them before the
    Kona meeting begins.
  - Tom explained that, if few people will be present in Kona, that he is inclined not to
    reserve a room, but rather to have both in-person and remote attendees join a Zoom
    meeting for discussions.
  - PBrett suggested that any such meetings should be planned for early morning Kona time
    in order for remote attendees in Europe and the US east coast to be able to attend.
  - Jens explained his current plans and expectations for room setup and audio capabilities.
  - Jens cautioned that the conference wifi may not handle many in-person attendees using
    Zoom at the same time.
- [P2626R0: charN_t incremental adoption: Casting pointers of UTF character types](https://wg21.link/p2626r0):
  - Corentin presented the paper.
    - `char8_t`, `char16_t`, and `char32_t` are useful for their encoding assurances, but
      lack support in the standard library.
    - Unfortunately, we can't just assume UTF-8 with `char`-based types and avoid use of the
      UTF variants.
    - Some form of interconvertibility between `char`, `wchar_t`, and the UTF character types
      is needed for the latter types to be incrementally adopted.
    - Copying the content of an array of one character type to an array of another character
      type just because existing code needs to access it by the latter type is expensive.
    - None of the current language facilities enable zero cost interconvertibility.
    - The proposed functions are intended to have a narrow contract.
    - The names of the functions are intended to reflect the partitioning of character types
      that are always used with UTF data and other character types.
    - The functions are intended to provide interoperability in constant expressions.
    - The `basic_string_view` and `span` interfaces are provided for convenience.
    - The alias barrier based conversion operations that ICU uses are non-conforming, probably
      don't work reliably, and probably can't be made to work in the C++ core language.
    - \[ Editor's note: See
      [SG16 issue #67](https://github.com/sg16-unicode/sg16/issues/67)
      for more background information regarding the ICU alias barriers. \]
    - An interoperability solution is needed for the UTF character types to be adopted in
      practice.Â·
  - Victor asked how the proposed functions would work on a system where, for example,
    `wchar_t` is not the same size as `char16_t`.
  - Corentin responded that the functions are constrained such that the source and target
    types must have the same size and alignment; a call is ill-formed otherwise.
  - Victor requested that the paper be updated to explicitly state early in the paper what
    properties of the types must match for the operations to be well-formed.
  - Hubert stated that there are memory model concerns that may make this feature not
    worth pursuing; the proposed functions provide a very sharp feature.
  - Tom asked Corentin why he felt SG1 might want to review the paper.
  - Corentin responded that his understanding is that SG1 is generally consulted regarding
    the C++ abstract machine, the memory model, and concurrency concerns.
  - Jens explained that the concerns the paper raises have more to do with the object model
    than the memory model and that these concerns fall more under CWG than SG1.
  - Jens noted that
    [P2590 (Explicit lifetime management)](https://wg21.link/p2590),
    a paper with related concerns, was reviewed by LWG and CWG, but not by SG1.
  - Jens added that
    [P2590](https://wg21.link/p2590)
    completed work that began with
    [P0593 (Implicit creation of objects for low-level object manipulation)](https://wg21.link/p0593)
    and that paper also targeted LWG and CWG.
  - Corentin asked if the paper represents a good direction.
  - Hubert stated that the proposed semantics are such that, if these functions were called
    to replace a subobject, that the enclosing complete object would be destroyed.
  - Hubert repeated his assertion that the proposed semantics have sharp edges.
  - Hubert noted that there are on-going concerns involving `start_lifetime_as()` and base
    classes.
  - Jens commented that the complete object would only be saved from destruction if there is
    a *provides storage* relationship
    ([\[intro.object\]p3](http://eel.is/c++draft/basic#intro.object-3)
    between the subobject and the target type.
  - Jens suggested that a better approach might be to add `constexpr` support to
    `start_lifetime_as_array()`.
  - Jens added that it might be possible for `start_lifetime_as_array()` to offer additional
    guarantees in cases where an underlying type is shared.
  - Tom stated that there is a complicated relationship between the core language
    possibilities and how that impacts the library interface possibilities.
  - Tom expressed a preference for specifying an ideal library interface that then drives
    the core language needs.
  - Hubert expressed uncertainty with regard to how to word restrictions around usage of an
    enclosing object following a change of type for a subobject; use or destruction of the
    subobject via the enclosing object would have to be avoided.
  - Corentin said he would try to address that.
  - Corentin stressed that, once an object's type is changed, the memory for that object
    cannot be accessed as though an object of the previous type is there.
  - Hubert reiterated that a change of type for a subobject becomes very complicated.
  - Jens asked if the paper includes examples that are reflective of how this facility would
    be used in something like real world code.
  - Jens noted that the mailing list discussion indicated that conversion in one direction
    must be followed by a conversion back.
  - Corentin expressed uncertainty regarding what limitations must be imposed and voiced an
    assumption that, since the character types are trivial, there is more flexibility.
  - Jens stated that the core language has moved towards objects of a trivial type being
    destroyed at the same point as other types; in the past objects of a trivial type could
    be accessed after their point of destruction until their storage was destroyed.
  - Jens noted that there may be wording that states that destruction of a trivial object
    where an object of another type is present results in undefined behavior and provided
    [\[basic.life\]p6](http://eel.is/c++draft/basic.life#6)
    as a reference.
  - Tom described his understanding of how constant evaluation works in terms of
    interterpretation of an AST; constant evaluators can currently rely on the type system;
    changing the type of an object could lead to undefined behavior within the evaluator.
  - Hubert agreed with Tom's description and stated that multiple implementors should be
    consulted.
  - Corentin suggested that such problems might be avoided via dependence on an underlying
    type relationship.
  - PBrett asked why the object type is so problematic and why, if a region of memory
    contains bytes that represent UTF-8 encoded text, it can't simply be accessed as an
    array of `char8_t`.
  - Tom explained that constant evaluation is based on the C++ object model and that the
    concept of memory regions don't apply there.
  - Corentin further explained that compiler optimizers use
    [type based alias analysis (TBAA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alias_analysis#Type-based_alias_analysis)
    to eliminate re-reading memory and
    [dead stores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_store)
    (writes to memory that will never be observed according to the abstract machine)
    based on the type system.
  - PBrett suggested that such alias restrictions could be removed.
  - Hubert responded that doing so would impact performance.
  - Jens noted that `char8_t` raised the abstraction level in C++ but not in C since
    `char8_t` is a type alias of `unsigned char` there.
  - PBrett stated that the issue with the object model must be solved in order to specify
    a zero cost abstraction.
  - Hubert explained that there is a trade off; using both `wchar_t` and `char16_t`
    increases costs, but the latter provides encoding and portability guarantees.
  - PBrett opined that this suggests that use of the UTF character types is not zero cost.
  - Jens responded that C++ opted to add those types as fundamental types in order to
    support overload resolution.
  - Hubert explained the competing costs; restricting aliasing improves performance at the
    cost of having to workaround the type system.
  - Jens noted that `memcpy()` can be used to workaround the type system.
  - Tom noted that `memcpy()` can even be optimized away in some cases.
  - PBrett pondered whether the abstractions adopted for UTF character types were the
    right choice and noted that a library facility could have provided the same encoding
    guarantees while using `char` internally.
  - Tom explained that doing so wasn't an option for `char8_t` since UTF-8 string literals
    were already part of the core language.
  - Steve explained that we use the type system to annotate how a block of memory is used
    and that `char8_t` provided the ability to annotate a block of memory as holding UTF-8
    data.
  - Steve asserted that making the UTF character types aliasing types would impose costs
    like those he has seen with code that loops over `std::byte`; the aliasing behavior
    hurts code generation.
  - Steve noted that there are good libraries available that do use `char` and translate
    between code units and code points.
  - Corentin stated that the choice to make `char8_t` a non-aliasing type was intentional
    and that any such change would further harm adoption.
  - Corentin asserted that a way to use `char8_t` with historic `char`-based interfaces
    is needed or it just won't get used, but we'll still be left with the problems that
    motivated its introduction in the first place.
  - Corentin opined that strong types are needed to support the
    [Unicode sandwich model](https://nedbatchelder.com/text/unipain/unipain.html#35).
  - Corentin expressed a belief that this is solvable, implementable, and therefore should
    be specified.
  - Jens suggested that an alternative UTF-8 design could have been based on something like
    `std::span<char8_t>` over a sequence of `unsigned char`.
  - Jens opined that code unit types are not particularly interesting since an individual
    code unit by itself conveys little meaning.
  - Jens noted that the proposed library interfaces have rough edges and expressed
    skepticism regarding a need for anything UTF specific since the underlying functionality
    is not encoding dependent.
  - Steve agreed that the desire expressed in the paper is a special case of the problem
    where we want to get objects of one type out of a region of memory that holds objects of
    another type.
  - Steve also agreed that the underlying storage for a text type is not interesting; the
    interface provided is.
  - Steve noted that none of the suggested library solutions would have avoided the string
    literal concerns.
  - Hubert provided a list of what he termed "a few uncomfortable facts":
    - Reading object representations is allowed but the existing wording is not satisfactory
      and fixing it will be hard.
    - Implementations don't always follow the standard; for example, Clang's support for
      placement new is non-conforming.
    - Implementations sometimes implement behavior that can't be expressed in the standard.
    - Determining that wording is sufficient requires that multiple implementations are
      completed based on the wording.
  - Corentin, referring to earlier discussion regarding the possibility of making
    `start_lifetime_as_array` constexpr, noted that, since the memory location is provided by
     a parameter of type `void*`, any original source object type information is not present.
- Tom reported that the Unicode Source Code Ad Hoc Group suggested that SG16 author a paper
  to discuss the issues that have been reported following adoption of
  [P1949](https://wg21.link/p1949)
  for C++23 as a defect report and the migration from
  [immutable identifier syntax](https://unicode.org/reports/tr31/#Immutable_Identifier_Syntax)
  to
  [default identifier syntax](https://unicode.org/reports/tr31/#Default_Identifier_Syntax)
  in order to assist implementors with migration techniques, particularly in light of the
  intent for a future Unicode standard to introduce to default identifiers some currently
  excluded characters that are included in immutable identifiers.
  - Jens stated that he would like to understand more about the issues reported and requested
    that it be added to the agenda for a future meeting.
  - Hubert expressed an interest in understanding more about the discussion going on between
    WG21 and the Unicode Consortium.
  - Steve volunteered to add writing such a paper to his todo list.
  - Tom said he would file an SG16 issue to track the reported issues and submission of a paper.
  - \[ Editor's note: Tom filed
    [SG16 issue #79](https://github.com/sg16-unicode/sg16/issues/79). \]
- Tom stated that the next SG16 meeting is scheduled for September 14th and will likely
  include further discussion of
  [P2626R0](https://wg21.link/p2626r0)
  and the above requests for more information about the identifier issues and collaboration
  with the Unicode Consortium.


# July 27th, 2022

## Agenda
- [WG14 N3016: Unicode Length Modifiers v3](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n3016.pdf)

## Meeting summary
- Attendees:
  - Eskil Steenberg
  - Hubert Tong
  - Jens Maurer
  - Marcus Johnson
  - Peter Brett
  - Tom Honermann
  - Victor Zverovich
- [WG14 N3016: Unicode Length Modifiers v3](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n3016.pdf):
  - PBrett introduced the topic and invited Marcus to present his paper.
  - Marcus discussed the motivation for the paper; the desire to be able to easily format
    text in a Unicode encoding.
  - Tom provided a summary of the WG14 review of the paper during the recent WG14 meeting.
  - PBrett described how `gettext()` is used; a string in the string literal encoding is
    provided and a string in the current locale encoding is produced.
  - Tom stated that there is effectively a contract that the string produced by
    `gettext()` is encoded in the current locale encoding.
  - PBrett confirmed.
  - PBrett asked how `printf()` would handle formatting a UTF-16 encoded argument.
  - Tom replied that the existing practice for `wchar_t` based arguments is to convert them
    to the current locale encoding.
  - Tom asked if motivation exists for an alternative behavior.
  - Jens asked for an example of alternative behavior.
  - Tom replied that the string literal encoding could be used to guide conversions instead
    of the current locale and noted that this would match the behavior chosen for
    `std::format()` when the string literal encoding is a Unicode encoding.
  - Tom explained that such behavior would require preserving the string literal encoding
    for each translation unit and then somehow passing that information to `printf()`.
  - Jens noted that `std::printf()` and `gettext()` have different encoding expectations; the
    former expects the formatting string to be in the current locale encoding while the latter
    expects something else.
  - \[ Editor's note: The
    [GNU gettext man page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/gettext.3.html)
    states:
      > The msgid argument identifies the message to be translated. By
      > convention, it is the English version of the message, with non-
      > ASCII characters replaced by ASCII approximations.
    \]
  - PBrett stated that it is rare in his experience for a string literal to be passed as the
    format string to `printf()`.
  - Victor replied that in the code base he works on, approximately 50% of `printf()` calls
    pass a string literal.
  - Tom surmised that Victor's experience may reflect an assumption of UTF-8 as both the
    string literal encoding and the locale encoding.
  - Victor replied that third party libraries are more likely to not assume UTF-8.
  - Jens asked if there is motivation to introduce a `u8printf()`.
  - Tom replied that adding such an interface is an option.
  - Jens expressed belief that we have consensus that the future is UTF-8 and that
    transcoding operations should occur at program boundaries.
  - PBrett expressed acceptance of library UB as a result of passing a format string to
    `printf()` that is not encoded in the expected encoding.
  - Jens asked how `printf()` implementations recognize the '%' character today.
  - Hubert responded that `printf()` is required to be locale sensitive and that the code
    point value of the '%' character may vary across encodings.
  - Eskil professed that implementations simply search for a code unit that matches the
    ASCII encoding of '%'.
  - Jens argued that is an unlikely implementation choice for an EBCDIC-based system.
  - Hubert explained that the '%' character encoding is non-varying across EBCDIC code
    pages so a simple search for a code unit that matches the EBCDIC encoding works on
    such systems.
  - Jens surmised that, for implementations that support a locale encoding that is
    unrelated to the string literal encoding, there must exist a compile time decision
    regarding calls to `printf()`.
  - Hubert responded affirmatively and stated that the `printf()` family of functions have
    multiple entry points on z/OS.
  - \[ Editor's note: The z/OS C run-time library provides EBCDIC-based implementations
    and ASCII-based implementations. The latter exist to support an ASCII environment on
    z/OS systems. See IBM's
    [Enhanced ASCII support documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.3.0?topic=table-enhanced-ascii-support). \]
  - PBrett reported having seen cases where, if `printf()` was not locale sensitive, the
    results produced would not have matched expectations.
  - Tom agreed that we have established that the format string must match the locale encoding.
  - Eskil stated that, ideally, the string literal and locale encodings would match.
  - Hubert agreed but noted that the locale encoding is controlled by the program user as
    opposed to the program author.
  - Eskil observed that character conversions are not desirable in all cases and provided
    production of a JPEG header as an example.
  - Jens noted that there is no current proposal to implicitly convert the `printf()` format
    string to the locale encoding.
  - Eskil and others agreed that such a proposal would be ill-advised.
  - PBrett concluded that the current `printf()` behavior matches the needs of the paper; it
    must alreadly be locale encoding aware, so conversion between UTF encodings and the locale
    encoding is reasonable.
  - Hubert agreed assuming requisite functionality as proposed in JeanHeyd's transcoding
    facilities.
  - Hubert stated that it would be necessary to specify how transcoding errors are handled.
  - Tom expressed a belief that the C standard already specifies how such errors are handled
    via delegation to functions like `wcrtomb()`.
  - Hubert responded with a belief that the C standard requires that well-formed multibyte
    strings and well-formed wide strings always be interconvertible without loss.
  - Tom expressed surprise that such a requirement exist.
  - PBrett noted that the wording would need to specify whether the precision flag applies to
    code units, code points, or extended grapheme clusters (EGCs).
  - PBrett stated that additional flags could select either code units, code points, or EGCs.
  - PBrett asserted that the grapheme break algorithm is not too onerous a requirement.
  - Tom asserted that the precision flag must specify code units for consistency with other
    uses of precision flags and that written code units should not split code points or EGCs.
  - Hubert explained that the number of code units read from the input must not exceed the
    specified precision for security reasons.
  - Discussion ensued regarding the possibility of buffer overflows and existing uses of
    the precision flag.
  - Victor asked if the precision flag currently specifies the maximum number of input
    characters when performing wide character conversions.
  - Hubert responded affirmatively but suggested verifying.
  - PBrett noted that, for existing uses, code units is equivalent to characters.
  - Tom explained his understanding of the precision flag; that if the precision is *X*,
    then up to *X* code units are read, but only the complete code unit sequences are written.
  - Hubert responded that, if the input string had *X* code points, but the number of code
    units to write differs, then the same number of characters written would not match *X*.
  - PBrett asserted that it is common to use the precision to limit output.
  - Tom checked https://cppreference.com and reported that it claims that the `%s` specifier
    uses the precision to limit the maximum number of bytes to write.
  - Eskil expressed a preference towards designing for the future and that legal output
    always be produced.
  - Hubert checked the C standard and reported that the precision specifies the maximum
    number of output code units in the target encoding and that partial characters are not
    written.
  - Victor summarized; the precision is the amount of output to write and the remainder of
    what was read is discarded.
  - PBrett asserted that programmers expect the precision to express display width.
  - Hubert responded that existing behavior hasn't matched that expectation for as long as
    multibyte encodings have existed.
  - Hubert pondered whether field width has a meaning in this case.
  - PBrett replied that field width fills and that precision truncates.
  - PBrett asserted that what code authors really want is the ability to specify display
    width.
  - Tom asked if there is agreement that `printf()` does not currently have the ability to
    specify display width.
  - PBrett and Eskil responded negatively.
  - Discussion ensued regarding EGCs and display width.
  - Eskil expressed a preference that the C standard provide base level functionality and
    that additional functionality be built as libraries.
  - Eskil asserted that there isn't always a single best solution.
  - Hubert noted that, with regard to code points vs EGCs, splitting an EGC can produce
    misleading output.
  - PBrett noted that virtually all programs need to interact with text in some capacity.
  - Eskil stated that some capabilities are fundamental and provided the example of
    formatting a number.
  - Eskil stated that, with regard to string types, there are uses for a size+pointer
    string type, a size+buffer string type, a size+capacity+buffer string type, a
    string-with-allocator string type, and more.
- Tom indicated that the next meeting is scheduled for August 10th and that the agenda is
  yet to be determined.


# June 22nd, 2022

## Agenda
- Continue discussion of survey questions for the 2023 C++ Developer Survey.
  - Revise, add, and remove questions from the
    [draft survey document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lRU7uErn2Vc7LOGG2H3PrzCvmf69u8S_v-43by_Vb9c/edit?usp=sharing).

## Meeting summary
- Attendees:
  - Hubert Tong
  - Jens Maurer
  - Peter Brett
  - Steve Downey
  - Tom Honermann
- Continue discussion of survey questions for the 2023 C++ Developer Survey:
  - \[ Editor's note: The active revision at the start of the meeting can be viewed by selecting
    `File` | `Version history` | `See version history`, then selecting the version named
    "pre 2022-06-22 meeting", then clicking the rightward facing triangle next to the version
    name to "expand detailed versions"; this latter step is necessary to exclude detailed edits
    that otherwise interfere with numbering of the questions. \]
  - Tom asked attendees to nominate questions to be removed from consideration.
  - PBrett suggested removing Q1 (What character encoding(s) do you use for source files?) since
    we already have consensus for moving towards UTF-8 encoded source files.
  - PBrett asked how answers to Q1 would affect our decision making.
  - Jens concurred and asked hypothetically whether responses would entice us to, for example,
    add a translation phase 1 option to support GB18030 as we are doing for UTF-8 via
    [P2295 (Support for UTF-8 as a portable source file encoding)](https://wg21.link/p2295).
  - Jens noted that implementations that support non-UTF-8 source files will continue to support
    them and argued that there is nothing to be done within the standard.
  - Hubert suggested an alternative formulation that asks which scripts programmers are using in
    their source files and for which they might be using specific encodings.
  - Jens noted that
    [P2528 (C++ Identifier Security using Unicode Standard Annex 39)](https://wg21.link/p2528)
    assumes that everyone is using Unicode for their source file encoding and that encoding does
    not imply which scripts are being used.
  - Jens stated that use of a particular encoding such as ISO8859-1 does restrict what scripts
    can be used and that such information could potentially be used in confusability analysis.
  - Jens suggested the question could probe which scripts are used in conjunction with a
    non-Unicode encoding.
  - PBrett noted the existence of the Big-5 encoding and that it is being phased out in favor of
    GB18030 and UTF-8.
  - PBrett asked if we are at risk of discussing whether support for additional encodings should
    be mandated.
  - Hubert responded negatively and stated that the question is intended to probe the extent to
    which substantial use of non-Unicode encodings remains.
  - Tom stated that it sounds like we have not identified a use case for this question.
  - Tom struck Q1 from the draft document.
  - PBrett expressed uncertainty as to what Q2 (What character encoding(s) do you use for string
    literals?) is intended to ask and stated that it might be interpreted as asking if `L`, `u8`,
    `u`, or `U` prefixed literals are being used.
  - Tom replied that the question is intended to ascertain what encodings are being used for the
    encoding of ordinary (non-prefixed) literals in order to learn about trends occurring in the
    ecosystem.
  - Hubert noted that we now assume that if string literals are UTF-8, then the locale encoding
    is as well.
  - PBrett expressed a feeling of persistent saltiness over that assumption.
  - Jens stated that only `std::format` is currently pushing us towards Unicode in this way.
  - Tom stated that we seem to have no use case for this question.
  - Tom struck Q2 from the draft document.
  - PBrett suggested removing Q10 (How are the project(s) that you work on organized for
    Unicode normalization?) on the basis that few programmers are aware of Unicode normalization.
  - Tom responded that the question is intended to provide input regarding whether normalization
    should be reflected in the type system.
  - Steve stated that it doesn't matter for most programmers, but that it matters immensely for
    a few.
  - PBrett suggested it is not a good candidate question if we believe it impacts few programmers.
  - Tom struck Q10 from the draft document.
  - PBrett opined that Q13 (Do your project(s) use regular expressions for which the search
    pattern is not known at compile-time?) is important to determine if programmers create regular
    expressions using user input.
  - PBrett stated that it probes whether
    [CTRE](https://compile-time-regular-expressions.readthedocs.io/en/latest)
    is a suitable replacement for `std::regex`.
  - PBrett stated that Q14 (Which regular expression languages do you use?) appears to duplicate
    Q12 (What libraries do you use for regular expression support?).
  - Tom replied that Q14 is intended to ask which regular expression languages are being used; for
    example, which of the six languages supported by `std::regex` are being used.
  - Hubert stated that Q12 could be useful to determine whether collation support is useful and
    noted that use of POSIX languages may imply better locale support needs.
  - Jens observed that programmers might use those languages for other reasons.
  - PBrett replied that programmers tend to use whatever language the regular expression facility
    they are already using supports.
  - Tom struck Q14 from the draft document.
  - Jens asserted that Q15 (Do you use the signed char or unsigned char types for text processing?)
    is not interesting.
  - Hubert asked if that concern is motivated by the lack of standard library support.
  - Jens replied that iostream supports signed and unsigned char types.
  - Tom stated that the question is intended to help determine whether these types should be used
    exclusively as small integer types as opposed to character types.
  - Jens opined that programmers should use `char`, `char8_t`, etc... for character types.
  - PBrett noted that `unsigned char` is commonly used as a character type in C.
  - Tom stated that this reflects a policy issue regarding whether we intend to extend the standard
    library to support use of these types for text and stated we have no such intent.
  - Jens agreed, noted that the aliasing is unfortunate, and expressed support for not making the
    situation worse.
  - Tom struck Q15 from the draft document.
  - Jens expressed support for asking programmers how they support internationalization and
    localization.
  - PBrett suggested dropping Q19 (What libraries do you use for collation?).
  - Jens countered with a suggestion to merge
    Q17 (What libraries or operating system features do you use for language translation?),
    Q18 (What libraries do you use for localization?), and Q19.
  - Tom agreed to do so.
  - Tom pondered whether it is worth asking about prohibition of standard library facilities.
  - PBrett responded that we can infer avoidance of the standard library when programmers state
    that they use, for example, ICU, but not the standard library facilities.
  - Steve stated that the explicit locale capabilities present in `std::format` are representative
    of what programmers want.
  - PBrett asked about adding a free form field for programmers to state how they support
    localization.
  - Tom responded that it is difficult to extract data from free form entries.
  - Steve stated that it is useful to know that no one uses, for example, `stdcoll()`.
  - Tom asked if the "discourage or prohibit" language should be retained.
  - Jens replied negatively and stated that we want to know what they do use.
  - Hubert stated that Q16 (Do you use the C and C++ locale features?) is useful to know if, or
    to what extent, programmers depend on the C and C++ locale for identification purposes.
  - Tom agreed to simplify Q16.
  - Tom pondered what we would use the responses to questions about languages and scripts for.
  - PBrett replied that Visual Studio Code has
    [UAX#9 HL4](https://unicode.org/reports/tr9/#HL4) features intended to help with display of
    bidirectional text in source files; that information could be used for SG15 guidance.
  - Jens stated that the standard allows identifiers, literals, and comments to be written in
    many kinds of scripts; support for languages such as Japanese is intentional.
  - Jens added that he favors developing guidelines to encourage features like those that
    Visual Studio Code offers.
  - Tom noted that guidance will be forthcoming from the Unicode Source Code Ad-Hoc Group.
  - PBrett concluded that it sounds like we already know we want to support these features;
    the data could help establish urgency.
  - Jens agreed, but noted that implementors can decide for themselves what is and is not urgent.
  - Tom struck Q3 and Q4 from the draft document.
  - Tom opined that Q5 (Do you use characters other than the basic character set in identifiers)
    is probably irrelevant following the adoption of
    [P1949 (C++ Identifier Syntax using Unicode Standard Annex 31)](https://wg21.link/p1949).
  - Steve indicated that language specific concerns are best addressed in a code style guide.
  - Tom struck Q5 from the draft document.
  - Discussion ensued regarding poll bias and privacy concerns.
  - PBrett suggested we could ask which region of the world respondents are located in.
  - Jens replied that such a question might be one that the Standard C++ Foundation is interested
    in asking anyway; it may not need to be included within our quota of questions.
  - Hubert suggested it would be useful to emphasize culture as opposed to geographical location.
  - PBrett expressed a preference for asking which nation the respondent is in.
  - Tom suggested asking respondents what their native language is.
  - Jens replied negatively; there are many languages spoken in India.
  - Tom proposed striking Q6 (Do the projects you work on limit locale selection in deployment
    environments to those that use a specific character encoding?) on the basis that mainframes
    aren't going away any time soon.
  - Tom struck Q6 from the draft document.
  - PBrett suggested merging
    Q7 (What libraries do you use for text processing?),
    Q8 (How are the project(s) that you work on organized for text processing?), and
    Q9 (If your project(s) convert text to and from an internal encoding, what encoding(s) are
    used for the internal encoding?) based on an expectation that use of framework libraries like
    QT sufficiently answer these questions.
  - Jens noted that we already have agreement that we want utilities to convert to/from UTF-8 and
    possibly UTF-16.
  - Tom asked for clarification that such agreement is relative to locale dependent encodings.
  - Steve replied yes, but also to other specified encodings.
  - PBrett asserted that these questions have already been probed by JeanHeyd.
  - Tom explained that Q7 (What libraries do you use for text processing?) is really intended to
    ascertain what features are supported via non-standard libraries because the standard does
    not provide adequate support for them.
  - Jens suggested asking that question instead.
  - Tom agreed to rephrase Q7 accordingly.
  - Jens suggested asking what text processing features people most need; whether that be
    transcoding, Unicode algorithms, or something else.
  - Jens noted that regular expression support could be added to that list differentiated by
    compile-time vs run-time support.
  - Steve asserted that a laundry list would be ok.
- Tom stated that the next meeting is scheduled for July 13th but that we need new papers.

  - Final review pending the availability of an updated revision.
- Discuss survey questions to suggest for the 2023 C++ Developer Survey
  - Review questioned and topics suggested in the
    [mailing list discussion](https://lists.isocpp.org/sg16/2022/06/3214.php).

## Meeting summary
- Attendees:
  - Charlie Barto
  - Hubert Tong
  - Inbal Levi
  - Jens Maurer
  - Mark de Wever
  - Peter Brett
  - Steve Downey
  - Tom Honermann
  - Victor Zverovich
- [D2572R0: std::format() fill character allowances](https://rawcdn.githack.com/sg16-unicode/sg16-meetings/b37ca29e4d5802aeccaf3fe14568ee7427b2c19e/presentations/2022-06-08-d2572r0.html)
  - PBrett lamented the lack of a published revision with a "P" designation and change
    history that reflects the evolution of the design and wording.
  - Tom stated, in response to preferences expressed by Victor on the mailing list,
    that he will add a drafting note regarding the change of "specifier" to "option"
    in the description of the *align* grammar production so that LWG will be sure to
    review.
  - Jens requested that the drafting note regarding note renumbering be removed since
    the LaTeX machinery will handle that automatically.
  - Tom stated that he would add a note following the format examples that mentions
    that the clown face emoji has an estimated length of two.
  - PBrett suggested adding an example with a formatting argument that contains a
    character with an estimated width other than one; essentially an example that
    swaps the fill character and formatting argument in example `s7`.
  - Jens requested that note X be modified to drop "estimated" and to replace
    "width of the fill character" with "width of **any** fill character".
  - Jens expressed distaste for the existing wording in
    [\[format.string.std\]p11](http://eel.is/c++draft/format.string.std#11)
    that states "estimated width of ... UCS scalar values"; UCS scalar values are not
    characters.
  - Hubert noted a missing "the" in the same paragraph;
    "the sum of **the** estimated widths".
  - **Poll 1: Revise D2572R0 "std::format() fill character allowances" as discussed,
    and forward the paper so revised to LEWG as the recommended resolution of LWG3576
    and LWG3639.**

    - Consensus in favor.
- Discuss survey questions to suggest for the 2023 C++ Developer Survey
  - PBrett proposed separating the survey questions into two categories:
    - The form of the source code; how the source code is written.
    - The facilities used to perform text processing.
  - PBrett suggested that questions about tools might comprise an additional category.
  - Inbal suggested asking for input on what topics most urgently require solutions in
    the standard.
  - Tom replied that a free form question could be used for that and that the current
    developer survey presents such free form responses as a word cloud.
  - PBrett asserted that the questions should address the topics we most want to learn
    about.
  - PBrett suggested asking what facilities programmers are using in place of standard
    facilities like `std::regex` and `std::locale` that are known to have significant
    design issues.
  - Hubert noted that the standard notion of locale encompasses both interface and
    locale identification; a programmer may use `std::locale` or the C locale facilities
    for locale identification, but then use alternate facilities for locale dependent
    behavior.
  - PBrett pondered whether the facilities programmers actively use to support
    internationalization and localization is one of the topics we are most ignorant of.
  - Hubert responded that there is speculation that programmers avoid the standard
    facilities but that we don't have data to confirm that.
  - Steve stated that Bloomberg actively avoids the standard locale related facilities.
  - Victor suggested it might be helpful to ask if programmers are intentionally using
    the standard locale facilities and noted that many do so inadvertently.
  - Victor noted that the questions need to consider C and C++ locale facilities as
    distinct facilities.
  - PBrett suggested structuring the questions as:
    - "Do you provide internationalization support", and
    - "If so, how do you provide internationalization support".
  - Victor stated that those questions should include multiple selection responses
    that include C, C++, POSIX, etc...
  - PBrett suggested adding ICU and other popular packages.
  - PBrett asked for additional topics that we might be particularly ignorant about.
  - Steve suggested asking if programmers are still having to work with multiple character
    encodings within their main application and, if so:
    - whether they transcode at application boundaries and work exclusively with Unicode
      internally, or
    - whether they work directly with data in whatever character encoding it is provided in.
  - PBrett suggested it would be useful to know how often programmers use regular
    expressions where the pattern is not known until run-time.
  - Victor pondered whether Hana coerced Peter to ask that question.
  - PBrett responded that she did not, but that the question does concern whether and to
    what extent CTRE is a suitable substitute for `std::regex`.
  - Steve agreed that it would be useful to understand what the requirements for a
    replacement are.
  - Charlie stated that a replacement would need to be more ABI resilient but that there is
    no need to pass compiled regular expression objects across module boundaries.
  - Steve suggested asking which regular expression languages programmers are using.
  - PBrett responded that question requires an "I don't know" response option.
  - Tom asked if it would be helpful to know how many programmers are using `TCHAR` in
    Windows environments.
  - Charlie reported suspicion that many programmers are still using that.
  - Tom wondered what we might do with such data if we had it.
  - PBrett suggested it would be interesting to know what libraries programmers are
    using for Unicode algorithm support and string classes.
  - Tom asserted that that question would need to be multiple choice with an
    "other" option.
  - Tom recalled one of the questions Peter had suggested on the mailing list,
    "what language(s) do you use in identifiers and comments?", and asked whether the
    question was intended to probe the languages used or whether characters outside the
    basic character set are being used.
  - PBrett replied that the interest is in the language; the goal is to find out which
    scripts are being used.
  - Tom recalled one of the questions Zach suggested,
    "How often do you use multiple Unicode normalization forms in the same program?"
    and commented that this is similar to the encoding question; whether programmers
    normalize at program boundaries or not normalize at all.
  - Steve stated this is an important consideration for deciding if normalization
    belongs in the type system.
  - Tom mentioned that Zach also posed questions about collation support.
  - Steve replied that collation needs depend on context; data in a database is likely
    to be ordered in a locale independent manner but may need to be reordered for
    presentation in a user's locale.
  - Inbal asked if serialization is within the purview of SG16.
  - Tom replied that it could be for producing and consuming text formats.
  - Inbal stated that, given a list of keywords, it would be possible to scrape
    stackoverflow.com for related questions.
  - Tom wondered about asking if programmers place locale constraints on their users;
    for example, whether they require use of UTF-8.
  - Hubert responded that such a question won't garner a 100% yes answer, so may not
    be so helpful.
  - Tom replied that it might be useful to help guide where we invest effort; if lots
    of products support non-UTF-8 environments, then we know to focus more broadly.
  - Hubert agreed with that perspective.
  - PBrett stated that a transcoding facility remains high on our priority list and
    asked if the question about internal encodings and translation at program boundaries
    was intended to probe actual need.
  - Tom responded that he had not thought about that relationship concretely.
  - Steve suggested that question is more related to how many programmers need to
    operate directly on text in multiple encodings and if facilities are needed to do so.
  - Hubert stated that gathering interest in a rope class would be useful.
  - Tom asked if that would be for the case of stringing together blocks of text that are
    differently encoded.
  - Hubert responded affirmatively.
  - PBrett noted such a type is also useful in cases where buffers are in different places.
  - Tom pondered what we would do with data regarding which character types are in use; for
    example, whether we would choose not to focus on `char32_t` as anything other than a
    code point type.
  - Steve suggested asking if programmers use `signed char` and `unsigned char` for text as
    opposed to for use as small integers like `int8_t` and `uint8_t` or for other forms of
    bit manipulation.
  - Hubert responded that `unsigned char` is likely used for UTF-8.
  - Victor responded that `unsigned char` is often used for `uint8_t` and that this causes
    formatting confusion.
  - Inbal asked if C and C++ compatibility is important.
  - Tom replied that it is helpful to decide if we need low level C utilities that are
    exposed via C++ wrappers.
  - Tom added that JeanHeyd has been pursuing the approach of getting low level facilities
    for transcoding through WG14 before continuing work on transcoding support in WG21.
  - PBrett raised the question of which kind of C string interfaces are important;
    null terminated vs Pascal strings.
  - PBrett mentioned WG14 Annex K and noted that Microsoft can't ship it due to conflicts
    with their historical secure function implementation.
  - Hubert returned to the topic of localization and stated it would be useful to know if
    programmers customize locale formatting or just rely on default formatting.
  - Tom stated that he will draft a Google doc with an initial set of questions based on
    this discussion that we can all comment on and contribute to.
  - Further discussion ensued regarding stability vs the need to evolve and fix defects.
- Tom stated that the next meeting will be on 2022-06-22 and that, if we make good progress
  refining and suggesting survey questions in the interim, then we'll probably continue this
  discussion then.

  - Review for familiarity and relevance to
    [P1949: C++ Identifier Syntax using Unicode Standard Annex 31](https://wg21.link/p1949).

## Meeting summary
- Attendees:
  - Charles Barto
  - Hubert Tong
  - Jens Maurer
  - Mark de Wever
  - Robin Leroy
  - Steve Downey
  - Tom Honermann
- In honor of a new attendee, a round of introductions was conducted.
- [D2572R0: std::format() fill character allowances](https://rawcdn.githack.com/sg16-unicode/sg16-meetings/ad0a0ed160ef6216954c699ba5b8497190eaf29c/presentations/2022-05-25-d2572r0.html)
  - Tom presented the paper.
  - Robin pointed out a spelling error; "IDIOGRAPHIC" -> "IDEOGRAPHIC" (two occurrences).
  - Charlie explained that the ABI mitigation technique discussed in the
    "Future considerations and ABI" section relies on persistence of at least the fill character
    portion of the format string but such persistence is not otherwise currently required
    because the format string is evaluated at compile-time.
  - Charlie stated he could imagine ways of accomplishing the goal though.
  - Tom asked for confirmation that the Microsoft implementation is already shipping and
    locked into its current ABI.
  - Charlie confirmed that is the case.
  - Tom stated that he would add a note to the ABI section stating that some implementations
    are already locked in to their current behavior.
  - Steve commented that there are escape hatches and that other extension means are possible
    should the need arise.
  - Charlie explained why implementing ABI resiliency would likely impose dynamic memory
    management costs including possible lifetime management challenges.
  - Jens reported finding it a bit concerning that the estimated width of a character would be
    honored in some cases but not in others, but recognized the trade offs involved.
  - Jens stated that boilerplate wording is needed within the format section in order for the
    proposed use of "U+007B LEFT CURLY BRACKET" and "U+007D RIGHT CURLY BRACKET" to be
    applicable to the literal encoding.
  - Tom stated that the proposed wording changes to table 64 need work; in
    "if that value is negative", it is not clear whether "value" refers to "*n*" or to
    "the width of the formatting argument".
  - Jens requested that "estimated" be inserted before "width" in
    "the width of the formatting argument".
  - Hubert stated that "formatting argument" doesn't sound like the right term in this context;
    it should probably be "formatted argument".
  - Tom reported that this term was used for consistency with wording elsewhere but that he
    would review and try to improve.
  - Jens requested that the note following table 64 be modified to replace "ignored" with
    "assumed to be 1".
  - Tom agreed.
- [L2/22-072R: Proposal for amendments to UAX#9 and UAX#31](https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2022/22072r-uax9-uax31-amd.pdf)
  - Tom provided a brief introduction.
  - Hubert asked if it is necessary to address the UAX31-R3 conformance concern for C++23.
  - Tom replied that he did not believe so since the annex is non-normative.
  - \[ Editor's note: Zoom crashed for Tom and it took him several minutes to get reconnected.
    Jens assured him that the time missed primarily concerned the flogging of a dead horse. \]
  - Jens asked what version of Unicode is expected to receive the proposed amendments.
  - Robin replied that Unicode 15 is expected to have these updates and that more significant
    normative changes are anticipated for Unicode 16.
  - Robin stated that Unicode 15 is expected to be released in September.
  - Jens observed that September would be just in time for adoption in C++23.
  - Steve suggested that the annex could be updated to claim non-conformance with UAX31-R3.
  - Hubert agreed and noted that we may not want to change our dated UAX31 reference at that
    late point in the C++23 release cycle.
  - Jens proposed that we proceed with an NB comment on the C++23 committee draft to request
    upgrading the bibliography reference for UAX31 to Unicode 15.
  - Jens explained that, since the new Unicode release won't be available before then, it won't
    be possible to act on a core issue and an NB comment would end up being required anyway.
  - Robin directed discussion to allowances for U+200E LEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK (LRM) and
    U+200F RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK (RLM) to be used in combination with other whitespace.
  - Robin stated that example wording can be found in the Ada 2012 reference manual;
    [section 2.2 paragraph 7 1/3, "Lexical Elements, Separators, and Delimiters"](http://www.ada-auth.org/standards/rm12_w_tc1/html/RM-2-2.html#p7.1)
    states:
      > One or more other_format characters are allowed anywhere that a separator is;
      > any such characters have no effect on the meaning of an Ada program.
  - Jens noted that this would be a new kind of whitespace for C++ since sequences of these
    marks by themselves would not constitute whitespace.
  - Jens expressed curiosity regarding "implicit directional marks" as discussed in L2/22-072R.
  - Robin replied that "implicit directional marks" is discussed in
    [UAX #9 section 2.6, "Implicit Directional Marks"](https://unicode.org/reports/tr9/#Implicit_Directional_Marks).
  - Robin explained that, per
    [UAX #9 section 6.5, "Conversion to Plain Text"](https://unicode.org/reports/tr9/#Conversion_to_Plain_Text),
    such marks may be implicitly inserted during conversion to plain text for text subject to protocol
    [UAX9-HL4](https://unicode.org/reports/tr9/#HL4)
    and that Unicode 15 will recommend that protocol for source code text.
  - Hubert asked if it would make sense to prohibit sequences consisting of more than one of
    these marks.
  - Robin replied that he knew of no motivation for doing so; that the presence of multiple
    marks should not pose any negative consequences.
  - Jens expressed opposition to these marks constituting whitespace separation in isolation.
  - Tom agreed.
  - Jens noted that specification of LRM and RLM in whitespace will have to target C++26 as
    C++23 is now closed to new language changes.
  - Jens suggested that such a change could be adopted as a DR against C++23 to encourage
    recognition of these marks as a conforming extension in prior language modes.
  - Jens stated that a paper will be needed and that it should await the availability of
    Unicode 15.
  - Tom stated he would file a SG16 github issue to track the request for such a paper.
  - \[ Editor's note: Tom filed
    [SG16 issue 74: Extend whitespace to include NEL, LS, PS, LRM, RLM, and maybe ALM](https://github.com/sg16-unicode/sg16/issues/74). \]
  - Tom noted that this isn't a particularly urgent issue to address.
  - Jens countered that it would be helpful to prevent obfuscated display of source code
    and that the desire to avoid such confusion has gained prominence in recent times.
  - Jens directed discussion towards future conformance with UAX31-R3 and that there are
    questions about `Pattern_White_Space` that need to be answered.
  - Robin asked which `Pattern_White_Space` characters are not considered whitespace in
    C++.
  - Hubert listed them; they are all the ones outside the ASCII subset.
    - U+0085 NEXT LINE
    - U+200E LEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK
    - U+200F RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK
    - U+2028 LINE SEPARATOR
    - U+2029 PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR
  - Hubert noted that the above characters can only appear in comments and character or
    string literals currently.
  - Jens asked if it is the intent of UAX31-R3 to require that all of the characters in
    `Pattern_White_Space` be supported as whitespace.
  - Robin replied that allowing a subset would render the requirement vacuous.
  - Jens suggested the possibility of updating UAX31-R3 to specify a minimal subset.
  - Robin responded that a sub-requirement like UAX31-R3a could be introduced; such
    sub-requirements can be found elsewhere in UAX #31.
  - Steve noted that the current normative text of UAX31-R3 allows deviation by specifying
    a profile.
  - Hubert asked what motivation exists for not accepting the other whitespace characters.
  - Steve noted existing practice and suggested this be addressed in the future paper.
  - Jens directed discussion to conformance with the `Pattern_Syntax` requirement of
    UAX31-R3.
  - Robin expressed a belief that C++ conforms to that.
  - Tom expressed curiosity with regard to the presence of `.` in `Pattern_Syntax` and
    its use within floating point literals.
  - \[ Editor's note: Tom's concern stems from the following note in the description of
    UAX31-R3. Is the use of `.` in floating point literals considered syntax or part of
    a literal?
      > **Note:** When meeting this requirement, all characters except those that have
      > the Pattern_White_Space or Pattern_Syntax properties are available for use as
      > identifiers or literals.

    \]
  - Hubert stated that this kind of confusion is why he is hesitant to declare conformance
    to UAX31-R3 prior to improved wording that will hopefully appear in Unicode 16.
  - Jens summarized the three tasks identified so far:
    - For C++23, file an NB comment after the July plenary to update
      [\[uaxid.pattern\]](http://eel.is/c++draft/uaxid.pattern)
      in annex E to state that conformance with UAX31-R3 is not claimed.
      At the same time, update the UAX references in the bibliography to refer to
      Unicode 15.
    - For C++26, author a paper to add LRM, RLM, and other `Pattern_White_Space` characters
      to the set of whitespace characters.
      If support for U+061C ARABIC LETTER MARK is also desired, that will require a profile
      to conform with UAX31-R3.
    - For C++26, update
      [\[uaxid.pattern\]](http://eel.is/c++draft/uaxid.pattern)
      in annex E to claim conformance with UAX31-R3.
      At the same time, update the UAX references in the bibliography to refer to
      Unicode 16 (or later).
  - Robin noted that Unicode 15 is planned for release on September 13th per
    https://www.unicode.org/versions/beta-15.0.0.html.
  - Tom recalled Hubert mentioning on the mailing list that
    U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR)
    can now be added to the basic character set.
  - Hubert acknowledged and opined that we can do so as part of
    [P2348: Whitespaces Wording Revamp](https://wg21.link/p2348).
  - Tom stated that CR presumably should have already been present because of the existence
    of the `\r` escape sequence.
  - Jens explained that `\r` creates a requirement for literal encodings but not for the
    basic character set nor an allowance for its use in whitespace.
  - Tom noted that a paper will be needed that targets SG15 and discusses the concerns and
    options available to implementations with regard to UAX9-HL4 and presentation of source
    code that contains right-to-left characters.
  - \[ Editor's note: Tom filed
    [SG16 issue 75: SG15 proposal for implementations that present source code to conform with UAX9-HL4](https://github.com/sg16-unicode/sg16/issues/75)
    to track producing such a paper. \]
- Tom stated that the next meeting will be in two weeks, on 2022-06-08.

  - Victor summarized recent wording changes worked out on the SG16 mailing list.
  - Victor asked if "code point" should be preferred over "character" in the proposed wording
    for \[format.string.escaped\]p2.
  - Tom replied that he is unaware of any normative use of "code point" in the standard today.
  - Victor responded that it is used in the wording for format field width estimation.
  - Hubert stated that the usage there is in a Unicode specific context and that "character"
    is probably most appropriate here.
  - Hubert pointed out that, in \[format.string.escaped\]p2.3, it is odd that *c* is defined
    as a character, but then compared with UCS scalar values.
  - Jens agreed and proposed substituting "character" for "UCS scalar value" in paragraph
    2.3.1 and in the header of the associated table.
  - Jens suggested doing likewise in paragraph 2.3.3.
  - Hubert argued that a change is not needed in 2.3.3 due to the use of "corresponds".
  - Tom noted the use in that paragraph is also a Unicode specific context.
  - Tom asked Charles if he continues to have concerns regarding the lack of specification
    for determining the boundaries of ill-formed code unit sequences.
  - Charles replied that he does and that he would like to see it addressed via a reference
    to the [WHATWG Encoding Standard](https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org).
  - Tom responded with uncertainty whether such a normative reference is possible given the
    lack of versioning around that standard.
  - Charles suggested that the method specified in the WHATWG standard could be replicated
    in the C++ standard; we want the "maximal subpart" behavior described by policy option 2
    in [Unicode PR-121](http://unicode.org/review/pr-121.html).
  - Hubert asked if that policy is defined for all UTF encodings.
  - Charles replied that it is.
  - PBrett asked what the motivation is for rigorously specifying how the boundaries of
    ill-formed code unit sequences are determined.
  - Charles replied that the goal is to ensure consistent output, but then noticed that, in
    this case, the method used does not appear to be observable since each code unit of the
    sequence is written to the output anyway.
  - Tom agreed that it should not matter for self-synchronizing encodings.
  - Charles noted that this will be the first instance of Unicode UCD properties being
    normatively required by the C++ standard.
  - Charles suggested that, if we're ok with such normative use, we could revisit the wording
    for estimated format field widths to make the uses there normative as well.
  - \[ Editor's note: [\[format.string.std\]p11](http://eel.is/c++draft/format.string.std#11)
    specifies normative encouragement of behavior that depends on UCD properties in order to
    identify extended grapheme cluster boundaries. \]
  - \[ Editor's note: This would not be the first normative use of the UCD properties;
    [\[lex.name\]p1](http://eel.is/c++draft/lex.name#1) requires the `XID_Start` and
    `XID_Continue` properties to determine identifier boundaries and validity. \]
  - Jens requested that such changes not be handled via this paper.
  - Steve asked how much data is required for the new uses of the `General_Category` and
    `Grapheme_Extend` properties.
  - Victor replied that the necessary data fits in ~1K.
  - Charles agreed and shared a
    [link to code](https://github.com/microsoft/STL/blob/main/stl/inc/__msvc_format_ucd_tables.hpp)
    used to implement a grapheme break algorithm that uses the `Grapheme_Cluster_Break` and
    `Extended_Pictographic` properties.
  - Charles noted that some creative packing is necessary to get the size that small.
  - Tom expressed surprise that `Grapheme_Extend` is small.
  - Victor replied that it is composed of a number of compressable ranges.
  - \[ Editor's note: The set of all characters that satisfy the `Grapheme_Extend=yes` property
    can be viewed
    [here](https://util.unicode.org/UnicodeJsps/list-unicodeset.jsp?a=%5B%3AGrapheme_Extend%3DYes%3A%5D&g=&i=);
    that set comprises 2090 code points in Unicode 14. \]

    - No objection to unanimous consent.
- [P2558R1: Add @, $, and \` to the basic character set](https://wg21.link/p2558r1)

## Agenda
- [P2286R7: Formatting Ranges](https://wg21.link/p2286r7)
  - Review recent updates and confirm direction.
- [P2558R1: Add @, $, and \` to the basic character set](https://wg21.link/p2558r1)
  - Review recent updates.

## Meeting summary
- Attendees:
  - Hubert Tong
  - Jens Maurer
  - Peter Brett
  - Steve Downey
  - Tom Honermann
  - Victor Zverovich
  - Zach Laine
- [P2286R7: Formatting Ranges](https://wg21.link/p2286r7)
  - \[ Editor's note: D2286R7 was the active paper under discussion at the telecon. The agenda
    and links used here reference P2286R7 since the links to the draft paper were not shared
    publicly. The published document may differ from the reviewed draft revision. \]
  - PBrett provided an introduction.
  - Victor explained that LWG reviewed the wording and conditionally approved the paper subject
    to SG16 review.
  - PBrett recalled concerns raised in the past regarding the use of Unicode properties.
  - Victor replied that implementors were present during the LWG review and did not express
    any objections or concerns.
  - Victor noted that Hubert provided some wording tweaks during the LWG review.
  - PBrett presented wording updates Tom
    [proposed on the SG16 mailing list](https://lists.isocpp.org/sg16/2022/04/3111.php).
  - PBrett expressed a preference for Tom's wording relative to the current wording.
  - Victor stated that he is ok with Tom's wording so long as it is equivalent to the
    current wording in the paper for the Unicode case.
  - Victor stated that he would prefer not to defer to other format facilities for the
    description of how hexadecimal values are formatted.
  - Hubert expressed a desire to document spacing and non-printable characters by their
    encoded values as opposed to their character names or glyphs.
  - Hubert explained that doing so would free the library from having to be aware of the
    literal encoding selected at compile-time.
  - Tom acknowledged the concern; the set of spacing and non-printable characters, or
    their encoded values may differ for one literal encoding vs another.
  - Hubert noted that the concern applies to both EBCDIC and Windows code pages.
  - Hubert stated that the proposed wording could produce strange results in cases where
    unnecessary shift states are present.
  - PBrett observed that the current wording does not state which encoding is used in cases
    where printable characters overlap with control characters in a related encoding, but
    the proposed wording does.
  - Jens noticed that the proposed wording states that the literal encoding is used to
    construct *E*, but not to interpret *S*.
  - Tom acknowledged the omission and stated that it needs to be corrected.
  - PBrett returned to his example where a locale encoding overlays graphical characters
    over control characters and noted that the overlayed characters would be interpreted
    in the literal encoding.
  - Hubert reported that his implementations are not affected by overlay concerns and that
    locale support can be added later if motivated.
  - Zach asked if the method for determining whether *S* is in a Unicode encoding matches
    the method specified for `std::format()` in C++20.
  - Tom replied that he didn't recall how it was specified.
  - \[ Editor's note: It does not appear to be specified. The relevant wording simply states
    "For a string in a Unicode encoding, ...". See
    [\[format.string.std\]p11](http://eel.is/c++draft/format#string.std-11),
    [\[format.string.std\]p12](http://eel.is/c++draft/format#string.std-12), and
    [\[format.string.std\]p14](http://eel.is/c++draft/format#string.std-14).
    Improvements appear to be warranted. \]
  - Jens stated that, with the exception of the use of *CE* for string *S*, this is
    well-specified so long as it matches the desired behavior.
  - Tom noted that `std::format()` is intentionally locale independent.
  - Hubert reported that his implementations will likely assume a certain literal encoding
    rather than storing the literal encoding actually used at compile-time; that encoding is
    likely to be EBCDIC 1047 or, for ASCII contexts, ISO-8859-1.
  - Hubert expressed his understanding of the design intent to be that an escaped sequence
    can be interpreted to reproduce the original byte sequence.
  - Hubert suggested that it may be worth adding a note to that effect.
  - Tom acknowledged the intent and noted that his wording fails to reflect that intent for
    stateful encodings since state transitions in *S* should be reflected as escape sequences
    rather than interpreted when constructing *E*.
  - PBrett asked for other concerns.
  - Tom noted that there is the issue of handling boundaries of ill-formed code unit sequences
    and asked if anyone wanted to argue for addressing that now.
  - PBrett expressed a preference not to address it now.
  - Hubert suggested it could be unspecified or implementation-defined.
  - Tom replied that it is more-or-less implied at present.
  - PBrett agreed.
  - Tom summarized the discussion; we agree that we want revised wording for this case but that
    we don't quite have what we want yet.
  - Tom said he will inform LWG that we'll continue iterating on the wording with the intent
    to have something approved by our next meeting in two weeks.
  - Hubert agreed with the summary.
  - Victor gave a thumbs up.
- [P2558R1: Add @, $, and \` to the basic character set](https://wg21.link/p2558r1)
  - \[ Editor's note: D2558R1 was the active paper under discussion at the telecon. The agenda
    and links used here reference P2558R1 since the links to the draft paper were ephemeral.
    The published document may differ from the reviewed draft revision. \]
  - Steve reported that the prose was updated to record the results of prior discussions in
    order to better explain the intent; the wording has not been changed.
  - Steve presented the paper and noted that section 3 is new.
  - Tom suggested adding a comment in section 3.1 (Universal Character Name) to indicate the
    character corresponding to `\u0060`.
  - PBrett reported a typo in section 3.4, "sting literal" should be "string literal".
  - PBrett noted that, with respect to existing use of these characters, they are usually used
    for convenience where another mechanism could be used.
  - Steve agreed and noted that such use generally occurs in contexts that require some kind
    of magic and where they can generally be escaped in some way.
  - Tom stated that, with regard to raw string literals, a reason to exclude the new characters
    in the delimiter portion is because these characters might acquire meaning in the future
    that could become problematic.
  - Tom expressed a preference to exclude \` for now so that we can preserve it for use as a
    new type of string literal.
  - \[ Editor's note: Such exclusion is unnecessary; the raw string literal delimiter pattern
    is bounded by a double quote and a parenthesis. Allowing use of \` in between those poses
    no ambiguity for a hypothetical new string literal delimited by \`. \]
  - Tom suggested the paper explicitly note that the proposed changes enable these characters to
    portably be used in character literals by virtue of being encoded as a single code unit.
  - Steve agreed to update the paper.
  - PBrett reported another typo in section 3.3, "invarient" should be "invariant".
  - Jens expressed a continuing interest in the paper showing examples of behavioral changes.
  - Hubert noted that such examples should be added to annex C.
  - Steve reported two known compatibility issues:
    - Use of a UCN to name one of these characters in stringification.
    - Use of a UCN to name one of these characters as an argument to a function-like macro that
      does not use the corresponding parameter.
  - Steve stated that SG22 may want to review these updates.
  - Steve suggested it may suffice to forward an updated paper via an SG16 mailing list review.
  - Tom agreed.
- Tom stated that the next meeting will be May 11th and will hopefully include review of an
  updated revision of D2572R0 (std::format() fill character allowances).


# April 13th, 2022

## Agenda
- [P2558R0: Add @, $, and \` to the basic character set](https://wg21.link/p2558)
  - Initial review.
- [D2572R0: std::format() fill character allowances](https://rawcdn.githack.com/sg16-unicode/sg16-meetings/c84e3e4eef341795fb9ac44824525a3a89583fa7/presentations/2022-04-13-d2572r0.html)
  - Initial review.

## Meeting summary
- Attendees:
  - Charles Barto
  - Hubert Tong
  - Jens Maurer
  - Mark de Wever
  - Peter Bindels
  - Peter Brett
  - Steve Downey
  - Tom Honermann
  - Victor Zverovich
- [P2558R0: Add @, $, and \` to the basic character set](https://wg21.link/p2558)
  - PBrett asked whether this proposal is an SG16 concern.
  - Tom replied that we are the encoding experts and best equipped within the committee to evaluate 
    whether these changes will have consequences for source character sets used in practice;
    our affirmation of the proposal will hopefully ease progress through other groups.
  - Charlie asked for confirmation that SG22 will review the paper as well.
  - Steve replied affirmatively and stated WG14 has already adopted the proposal for C.
  - Someone (apologies, the editor neglected to record who) noted the existence of
    [P2342: For a Few Punctuators More]([https://wg21.link/p2342)
    and that it argues that these characters could be used as new operators.
  - Tom responded that P2342 is an example of a paper that is not an SG16 concern; once the
    characters are available in the source character set, how they are used is an EWG concern.
  - Hubert observed that this introduces a requirement that these characters be encoded as a
    single code unit.
  - Jens acknowledged and noted that this is required by
    [\[lex.charset\]p6](http://eel.is/c++draft/lex.charset#6)
    for all characters in the basic literal character set.
  - Jens requested that the paper prose discuss this requirement.
  - Steve agreed to add such prose.
  - Jens stated that he does not know if this requirement would be problematic for any existing
    character sets.
  - Steve replied that there are infrequently used EBCDIC code pages that lack them.
  - Jens asked if those code pages also lack other characters.
  - Steve responded that they probably do.
  - Charlie asked if those problematic EBCDIC code pages have unused code points that could be
    used for these characters.
  - Tom suggested that digraphs could be introduced to support those code pages if needed.
  - Jens replied that digraphs can't be used inside character or string literals.
  - Steve suggested this concern can be addressed if these characters start getting used
    within the standard.
  - Jens reported that the addition of these characters to the basic character set makes them
    ineligible to be specified via a *universal-character-name* (UCN) outside of a character
    or string literal due to
    [\[lex.charset\]p3](http://eel.is/c++draft/lex.charset#3).
  - PBrett suggested that restriction could be lifted.
  - Charlie stated that existing uses of '$' are probably limited to identifiers and symbol
    renaming via attributes, pragma directives, or `asm` labels.
  - Hubert reported they may appear in preprocessor stringization.
  - PBrett reported they may appear in header names as well.
  - Jens noticed that use of a UCN to`#include` a source file named with one of these characters
    would become ill-formed.
  - PBrett reiterated support for lifting restrictions on use of UCNs to name characters from the
    basic character set with the rationale that we shouldn't ban things that are only bad ideas.
  - Charlie stated that, if such incompatibilities were to cause problems in practice, then
    lifting that restriction would be the obvious solution.
  - Steve suggested such concerns can be addressed after the paper is approved; we know programmers
    want to use these characters.
  - Tom asked Steve if he knows whether the UCN concern was discussed in WG14.
  - Steve replied that it was not.
  - Hubert asked when UCNs are translated in identifiers and other preprocessor tokens.
  - Jens replied, during translation phase 3 except in quoted contexts; so translation occurs as
    a *preprocessing-token* is formed.
  - PBrett observed that the new UCN restrictions would be limited to *h-char* and *q-char*
    sequences since these characters aren't otherwise usable outside quoted contexts.
  - Jens replied that they may also appear in a *preprocessing-token* used in stringization.
  - Hubert stated that a UCN specifying one of these characters would become ill-formed during
    stringization.
  - Hubert added that, likewise, use of a UCN to specify '$' in an identfier would become ill-formed.
  - Tom asked whether that matters since use of '$' in an identifier is already an extension.
  - Jens noted that these characters currently match the
    "each non-whitespace character that cannot be one of the above"
    case of
    [*preprocessing-token*](http://eel.is/c++draft/lex.pptoken#nt:preprocessing-token).
  - Jens requested that this discussion be included in the paper.
  - PBrett asked whether *h-char* and *q-char* sequences remain a backward compatibility concern.
  - Jens replied that they do, but that UCNs in such sequneces already have implementation-defined
    behavior; what UCNs mean in *h-char* and *q-char* sequences isn't really defined.
  - \[ Editor's note: Per
    [\[lex.phases\]p1.3](http://eel.is/c++draft/lex.phases#1.3),
    UCNs are not recognized and replaced in *h-char-sequence* and *q-char-sequence* sequences and, per
    [\[lex.header\]p1](http://eel.is/c++draft/lex.header#1),
    these sequences are mapped in an implementation-defined manner. \]
  - Tom suggested that it might be worth updating the paper to describe how existing implementations
    behave with respect to UCNs in preprocessor token concatenation, stringization and `#include`
    scenarios.
  - Jens asked if there are other ways in which these characters might plausibly be used today.
  - Tom replied that Objective-C uses '@'.
  - Jens mentioned the possibility of concerns being raised regarding the imposition of single code
    unit encoding for these characters on the execution character set.
  - Tom asked Hubert if he was aware of any EBCDIC related concerns.
  - Hubert replied that his colleagues in WG14 did not express such concerns and that he is confident
    that they would have if they had any.
  - Hubert noted that locales that don't support these characters would no longer be strictly
    conforming but could still be supported as extensions.
  - Tom summarized the discussion; there are requests to Steve to update the prose for several of
    the items discussed, but that there do not appear to be any objections to the paper direction.
- [D2572R0: std::format() fill character allowances](https://rawcdn.githack.com/sg16-unicode/sg16-meetings/c84e3e4eef341795fb9ac44824525a3a89583fa7/presentations/2022-04-13-d2572r0.html)
  - Tom provided an overview of the topic and prior discussions.
  - Tom asked for additional categories of characters that should be represented in the introductory
    table.
  - Tom stated that Zero-Width Joiner (ZWJ) and Zero-Width Non-Joiner (ZWNJ) cases were not added
    because he thought they were not interesting.
  - Tom noted that lone surrogates should not be possible.
  - PBrett suggested the bidirectional override characters.
  - \[ Editor's note: the bidirectional override characters are U+2066 through U+202E. \]
  - Tom agreed to add right-to-left and left-to-right examples.
  - Tom stated that extending fill character support to arbitrary extended grapheme clusters (EGCs)
    in the future would presumably impose an ABI break.
  - Mark agreed that it would; at least one implementation only stores a single code unit as the
    current wording appears to specify.
  - Charlie agreed and noted that another implementation stores the fill character as a code unit
    sequence with a maximum length of 4 code units for UTF-8.
  - Tom noted that, for the "Estimated display width restrictions" section, there is no good or
    right solution.
  - Tom asked if characters with an estimated width other than one were to be banned, how that would
    be accomplished without imposing undesirable overhead.
  - PBindels noted that the ZWSP case is interesting; if it were given an estimated-width of 0,
    then an infinite amount of padding would be required.
  - Charlie stated that the estimated width is not intended to be accurate; it is best effort.
  - Charlie stated that, in the "Existing practice" section, `std::format_error` is now thrown
    for the cases that previously produced the stack overflow for MSVC.
  - Charlie noted that the diagnostic is somewhat disappointing though since an invalid type is
    reported because the intended fill character does not match the *fill-and-align* grammar.
  - \[ Editor's note: The diagnostic produced by gcc with {fmt} is likewise disappointing. \]
  - PBrett suggested that a table that demonstrates the desired output inline with the proposal
    would be useful.
  - Victor stated that the paper direction makes sense and is consistent with previous guidance.
  - Victor pondered the consequences of diagnosing fill characters with an estimated width other
    than one; on one hand, it would be nice, but on the other hand, it adds overhead and
    potentially restricts valid use cases.
  - PBrett suggested that fill characters with an estimated width other than one could be
    conditionally supported.
  - PBrett stated that his preferred approach would be to diagnose at run-time (e.g., throw an
    exception) when alignment requirements could not be achieved due to the estimated width of
    the fill character.
  - PBindels reviewed the "Proposal" section and stated:
    - The first point to restrict to a single UCS scalar value seems sensible.
    - The third and fourth points appear to be consistent with what implementations currently do.
    - The second point is the questionable one.
  - PBrett suggested that the number of fill characters inserted could be unspecified when the
    fill character has an estimated width other than one.
  - PBindels replied that he considered that as well, but since the actual width is dependent on
    font selection, a consistent result may not be achieved anyway.
  - Charlie reminded the group that the estimated widths are not currently specified by any standard.
  - Charlie observed that diagnosing fill characters with an estimated width other than one will
    have the potential effect of rendering existing code invalid if estimated widths are changed
    in the future.
  - PBrett suggested another possibility that, if the fill character has an estimated width of two,
    then perform the alignment as if the fill character and all characters in the format argument
    have an estimated width of one; this would enable idiographic characters to be formatted properly.
  - Charlie responded that, if such a feature is desirable, then it would be preferable to add a
    flag to opt-in to it rather than inferring it based on the chosen fill character.
  - Tom agreed and noted that idiographic characters are just one special case.
  - Charlie stated that, for table style alignment, it is likely preferrable to emit a field
    separator character explicitly in the format string rather than to rely on the fill and align
    capabilities.
  - PBindels asserted that there is value to having well-defined portable behavior across
    implementations, so unspecified and implementation-defined behaviors should be avoided where
    possible.
  - Hubert asked if Victor has good examples of this facility being used with format arguments
    that have characters with estimated widths other than one regardless of fill character.
  - Victor replied affirmatively, but stated he did not recall specific examples; such cases
    involved terminal output.
  - Tom reported vague recollections of such examples being present in Victor's original papers.
  - PBrett stated that support for certain languages remains a concern for him and reported
    seeing Japanese characters reliably displayed in terminals in tabular formats.
  - Tom asked if he knew how the programmers were facilitating such output.
  - PBrett replied that he did not.
  - PBindels asked if it would be feasible to research what features would be useful for such
    languages.
  - PBrett replied that it isn't feasible for him to do so due to the number of possible
    solutions; he would like to allow implementations to be creative and see what the results bring.
  - PBindels again emphasized a desire for portable behavior.
  - Charlie agreed and stated that a creative solution in one implementation might produce an
    error in another.
  - Tom asked Peter Brett if it would suffice for an implementation to provide a flag to opt-in to
    an alternate behavior.
  - PBrett lamented the absence of attendees that are experts in non-Latin based languages.
  - Hubert questioned the frequency with which a programmer would want to use a fill character with
    an estimated width other than one; the programmer would presumably need to be able to specify a
    fill-remainder character or otherwise provide their own padding.
  - Victor agreed with the goal of specifying consistent behavior and suggested standardizing the
    demonstrated existing behavior in which a fill character is assumed to have an estimated width
    of one.
  - Charlie noted that a programmer can implement their own fancy formatter that produces a result
    that is then embedded using standard formatters.
  - Tom stated that it sounds like we have a few possible extension mechanisms that can be used
    for experimentation, work arounds, or future standard behavior.
  - Tom reported that he is leaning towards Victor's suggestion of specifying the currently
    demonstrated implementation experience.
  - PBindels indicated he would be content with any of the demonstrated outputs so long as behavior
    is consistent across implementations.
  - PBrett expressed concern about specifying particular behavior in the absence of more diverse
    expertise in SG16.
  - PBindels stated that he would reach out within his organization to try to find people with more
    diverse experience that would be interested in attending.
- Tom reported that the next meeting will be on 2022-04-27.

## Agenda
- ICU features to consider for C++26

## Meeting summary
- Attendees:
  - Charles Barto
  - Hubert Tong
  - Jens Maurer
  - Peter Brett
  - Steve Downey
  - Tom Honermann
- Tom introduced the topic:
  - Tom was inspired by Jens' assertion during the previous telecon that
    "the elephant in the room is ICU and the functionality it provides".
  - Based on that, Tom created a
    [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f-CLhYZIf_L0q1QBEqe2sVHyAofGx8Akt_xJKDGhcgA/edit?usp=sharing)
    containing a list of ICU feature categories annotated with Tom's opinions on whether
    such features are worthy of consideration for standardization in C++26 should suitable
    proposals materialize.
  - Tom would like to issue a Call for Papers covering the features we agree are worth
    consideration.
- Tom began reviewing the feature categories in the order they appear in the document.
- The categories enumerated below are those for which there were material comments.
- "Unicode character properties":
  - Tom pondered the benefits of exposing the set of raw UCD properties as opposed to just
    those that are needed for other features.
  - Charles responded that there are representation choices to be made based on usage.
  - Steve noted that support for segmentation requires many of the UCD properties.
  - Steve stated that it would be useful to expose all of the properties to enable experimentation.
  - Steve noted that, if there are design problems with how the data is exposed, that would be
    useful information.
  - PBrett observed that the UCD properties are needed to implement proper internationalization
    and localization support.
  - PBrett pondered whether exposing all UCD properties might create portability issues.
  - Tom asked if it might be reasonable to only expose properties with stability guarantees.
  - Steve replied that doing so probably would not be viable; some properties required for
    segmentation are not stable and there is a need to be able to fix things.
  - Tom noted the difference between data being stable as compared to property shapes being stable.
  - Steve acknowledged and noted that property shapes haven't changed in a while.
  - Steve added that the ICU maintainers would presumably push back hard if Unicode made significant
    changes to the shape of existing properties.
- "Sets of Unicode Code Points and Strings":
  - Tom commented that the items in this category appear to be simple utilities.
  - PBrett opined that may be a good reason to provide them.
  - Tom observed that they appear to be used to provide support for character classes.
- "Locales":
  - PBrett stated that one of the challenges with locale identifiers is that choice of locale is
    not fixed at compile-time.
  - PBrett added that locale IDs are subject to geopolitical changes.
  - Steve reported that there has been much work on client-side localization through
    [ECMA 402](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-402/), and
    [ICU4X](https://github.com/unicode-org/icu4x).
  - Steve expressed caution over trying to standardize something like ECMA 401 and ICU4X given that
    they are recent developments.
  - Steve noted that client side support uses browser based facilities.
  - PBrett wondered if C++ code compiled to WASM should transparently proxy to the local environment.
  - Tom asked whether new locale support could be built on `std::locale`, perhaps via new facets.
  - Hubert objected to such support built on new `std::locale` facets due to `std::locale` being
    dependent on C locale names.
  - PBrett replied that it would be useful to be able to get an ISO locale name from a standard locale.
  - Hubert noted that encoding information would be lost in that case.
  - PBrett agreed and asserted that encoding ideally wouldn't be a locale concern anyway.
  - Hubert replied that a particular script could be implied by `std::locale`.
  - Steve observed that we seem to be in agreement that we don't know how to do this today.
  - Tom stated that the problem is that proper case mapping, case folding, and collation can't be
    provided without proper locale support.
  - PBrett agreed and asserted the need for a plan to improve locale support.
- "Resource Bundles":
  - Tom suggested that this feature could be built on top of features like `#embed` and support for
    dynamic libraries; perhaps a downstream feature then.
  - Charles noted that Microsoft style resource management can be provided on other platforms using
    linker scripts.
  - PBrett opined that resources are a requirement for a good locale system.
- "Calendars and Time Zones" and "Date and Time Formatting":
  - Tom stated that base facilities exist that could be expanded, but that there are locale
    dependenices.
  - PBrett acknowledged concerns raised by Corentin on the mailing list that noted that the existing
    facilities are not at parity with the ICU features.
- "Message Formatting":
  - Tom stated that this is awaiting further developments from the
    [Message Format Working Group (MFWG)](https://github.com/unicode-org/message-format-wg).
  - PBrett commented that, what programmers want and what they need are not always the same thing.
  - Charles expressed a desire for experience outside the standard before pursuing support in the
    standard; even more so for this feature than for other ones.
  - Charles added that, ideally, a production quality application would be built on top of such a
    facility; one that has users using it from multiple locales.
  - PBrett opined that `std::format()` may not provide a great base to build this on.
  - Charles replied that it is probably usable, but not sufficient as is.
  - Tom stated there would presumably be a need to pass a message ID in place of a format string.
  - Charles reported that could be done using `std::vformat()`.
- "Text Transformation":
  - Tom suggested that, if there is a specific transliteration that we have motivation to provide,
    then we can do so; range adapters provide general support for this otherwise.
  - Steve noted that JeanHeyd's
    [ztd.text](https://ztdtext.readthedocs.io/en/latest)
    library can do some of this.
  - Hubert asked if this feature category is referring to technical transliteration or linguistic
    transliteration.
  - Tom replied that he did not know.
- "Bidirectional Algorithm":
  - Tom asked for confirmation that this does not have locale dependencies and is effectively
    about state management for layout purposes.
  - Steve replied that the algorithm is complicated as it tries to support all possible scenarios.
- "Collation":
  - Jens described a design possibility involving locale independent base functionality that
    operates on a set of locale dependent collation rules.
  - Jens stated that the rules engine would have to be sufficient to perform all tasks required
    by all locales.
  - Jens noted that such a facility could be useful as a building block for locale support and as
    a standalone facility.
- "String Searching":
  - Tom noted the locale dependence.
  - PBrett noted collation dependence.
  - Jens stated that precise requirements are needed and that basic element searching is present.
  - Hubert suggested this might be provided by a regular expression facility.
- "Text Boundary Analysis":
  - Steve stated there are natural range interfaces for this and that the interface is probably clear.
  - Hubert asked when a C++ programmer would use this.
  - Steve replied that he performs such analysis for reflowing text in outgoing email.
  - PBrett added that such support was an integral part of a DSP language he worked on.
  - Steve stated that word wrapping comes up in many scenarios.
- "Regular Expressions":
  - Tom suggested we consider this category if a paper arrives.
  - Tom noted that a proposed design would be locale dependent and would presumably have to operate
    on various string types, potentially including segmented text data structures.
  - PBrett pondered the possibility of a run-time only library with a narrow interface that could
    later be overloaded for new extensions.
  - Steve stated that this is not an area of his experties but that he would be willing to help
    author a paper if a good design were to be proposed.
  - Steve noted that there are many SG16 and LEWG related issues to consider.
- "StringPrep":
  - Hubert stated that this feature is related to string normalization for interchange purposes
    such as key lookup.
  - Jens noted that the
    [stringprep RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3454)
    specifies exclusion of certain characters and expressed a desire to better understand what this
    facility is used for.
  - Tom updated the Google Doc to change the consideration column value from "N/A" to "No", to
    add a reference to RFC 3454, and to note that this is a string normalization feature.
- "IDNA":
  - Tom expressed considerable ignorance of this topic.
  - \[ Editor's note: "IDNA" stands for "Internationalizing Domain Names for Applications" and is
    covered by [UTS #46](https://unicode.org/reports/tr46). \]
  - PBrett suggested such support might be needed for standard networking.
- "Universal Time Scale":
  - Tom suggested this is not an SG16 concern and could be tackled directly by LEWG if motivated.
  - Tom updated the Google Doc to change the consideration column value from "N/A" to "No; LEWG".
- "Paragraph Layout / Complex Text Layout":
  - Review of the ICU `playout.h` header revealed that this is an experimental facility.
  - Tom updated the Google Doc to change the consideration column value from "Not yet" to "No"
    and added a note about the facility being experimental.
- "ICU I/O":
  - Tom stated this is not an SG16 concern.
- Tom stated that the next telecon is scheduled for 3/23; the agenda is TBD.


# February 23rd, 2022

## Agenda
- Discuss objectives and priorities for C++26

## Meeting summary
- Attendees:
  - Charles Barto
  - Hubert Tong
  - Inbal Levi
  - Jens Maurer
  - Peter Brett
  - Steve Downey
  - Tom Honermann
  - Victor Zverovich
- Tom reminded the group about the upcoming SSRG meeting on Monday, February 28th, and encouraged
  the contribution of suggested improvements for
  [P2528R0 (C++ Identifier Security using Unicode Standard Annex 39)](https://wg21.link/p2528)
  to the author.
- Discuss objectives and priorities for C++26:
  - Tom asked the group for suggestions on what we should focus on for C++26.
  - Tom suggested alias barriers as a remaining core language feature improvement.
  - \[ Editor's note: See [SG16 issue #67](https://github.com/sg16-unicode/sg16/issues/67). \]
  - PBrett suggested improvements for access to command line options and environment variables.
  - \[ Editor's note: See [SG16 issue #66](https://github.com/sg16-unicode/sg16/issues/66). \]
  - Jens noted the existing practice for the `_wmain()` entry point in Microsoft Visual C++.
  - PBrett noted the `envp` parameter that POSIX adds to `main()`.
  - Tom suggested `std::rope` for chained text segments.
  - Steve suggested transcoding and lamented JeanHeyd's absence.
  - PBrett suggested an owning string type that eschews null termination.
  - Charles expressed concern that a string type that doesn't ensure null termination may not
    improve security due to programmers attempting to pass such data to functions that require
    a null terminated string anyway.
  - PBrett suggested that implicit conversions could be prohibited.
  - Steve noted the usability challenges such prohibition creates.
  - Victor stated that programmers will misuse such types even if implicit conversions are not
    supported; they will assume that, for example, a `data()` member function will provide a
    null terminated string.
  - PBrett replied that such concerns apply to the existing `std::string_view` type as well.
  - PBrett asserted there is room for a `std::string_view` like type that owns the string data.
  - Charles noted that having to pass a string held in such a type to a function that requires
    null termination would require having to copy the string contents just to add a null
    terminator and lamented the cost of such copies.
  - Jens asked PBrett what other features he might like to see in a new string type.
  - PBrett responded that he would mostly like to not have to write yet more string types that
    avoid null termination concerns.
  - Jens suggested that a string type that helps to avoid allocation and deallocation costs
    could be beneficial.
  - Jens stated he would prefer not to spend time in SG16 on general data structures.
  - Jens asserted that the elephant in the room is ICU and the functionality it provides and
    expressed a desire for a roadmap towards providing similar functionality.
  - Steve suggested that PBrett publish a paper extolling the benefits of a string type
    without null termination.
  - PBrett responded that benefits appear when working with databases and graphics.
  - Tom stated that, if a new string type were to materialize, he would like to know for sure
    what encoding it is intended to be used with.
  - PBrett offered two categories of such encoding assurances: 1) a type intended for text
    with an assumed encoding, and 2) a type that enforces well-formed encoding.
  - Steve offered a third category: 3) a type that maintains invariants like normalization form.
  - Steve reported having to investigate problems due to assumption of UTF-8 leading to errors
    when data was passed to Python programs that enforced well-formedness.
  - Steve stated that Bloomberg is strongly in favor of a type that maintains such invariants.
  - Charles expressed desire for a way to pass a filename on the command line that is preserved.
  - Charles explained that this currently isn't possible on Windows due to transcoding that
    occurs when preparing a command line to pass to `main()`.
  - Tom asked if it is possible to enter such names on the command line from Windows shells in
    the first place, but acknowledged it can be done from `CreateProcess()`.
  - Charles replied that tab completion and similar shell features can produce such names.
  - Tom asked to confirm that this should be considered a language issue as opposed to a shell
    issue.
  - Charles explained that other languages provide such mechanisms and noted that Rust has an
    `OsString` type that stores WTF-8 on Windows.
  - PBrett added that Rust is a good example of a language that provides strings that don't
    guarantee null termination.
  - Tom returned to discussion about features to focus on and suggested Unicode algorithms.
  - Hubert asked if ICU provides message formatting features.
  - Tom confirmed that it does.
  - PBrett noted the work that the Message Format Working Group (MFWG) is doing.
  - \[ Editor's note: The MFWG tracks its work
    [here](https://github.com/unicode-org/message-format-wg). \]
  - Tom suggested improved support for regular expressions as another feature to work on.
  - Charles replied that such work depends on whether the committee is willing to standardize
    a `std::regex2` or similar.
  - Charles stated that a new regex design would presumably face the same challenges that
    `std::regex` did and may therefore produce a similarly poor result.
  - Charles noted that regular expression support is a feature for which interoperability
    across libraries is not often needed.
  - PBrett asserted that a standard regex facility is beneficial because general programmers
    aren't particularly good at writing their own.
  - Charles suggested that a class intended to be used as a base class for string buffer
    management could be beneficial for building parsers; particularly a type that provides
    interfaces to peek ahead and push back.
  - PBrett suggested a `std::lexy` with reference to Jonathan MÃ¼ller's work.
  - \[ Editor's note: Jonathan's Lexy work is published
    [here](https://lexy.foonathan.net). \]
  - Tom asked if the work done on `std::format` provides a precedent for how to design a
    `std::regex` replacement that would be more isolated from ABI concerns.
  - Charles responded that `std::format` is fairly exposed to ABI concerns, but acknowledged
    the possibility of designing a more isolated type.
  - Victor stated that Hana DusÃ­kovÃ¡'s CTRE provides a good example of how to write parsers.
  - \[ Editor's note: Hana's CTRE work is published
    [here](https://compile-time-regular-expressions.readthedocs.io/en/latest). \]
  - PBrett asked about ideas for how to be more explicit about associating an encoding with
    existing text; e.g., how to have text in UTF-8 and pass it to something that requires UTF-16.
  - Steve asked if anyone recalled a proposal that would allow specifically binding to a string
    literal.
  - Tom stated that he did not but noted that a user-defined literal (UDL) can provide similar
    functionality.
  - \[ Editor's note: Tom was thinking of something like this:

        #include <cstddef>
        class string_literal {
        private:
            const char *p;
            string_literal(const char *p) : p(p) {}
        public:
            const char* data() const { return p; }
            friend string_literal operator ""sl(const char *p, std::size_t);
        };
        string_literal operator ""sl(const char *p, std::size_t) {
            return string_literal(p);
        }
        void f(const char*);
        void g(string_literal sl) {
            f(sl.data());
        }
        void h() {
            g("hello"sl);
        }
    \]
  - Steve stated that a facility that allows associating a dynamic encoding
    would be useful for scenarios in which the text and its associated encoding
    are not known at compile time.
  - Victor noted that encodings are often properties of interfaces and suggested that an
    attribute based approach to specifying encoding expecations could be helpful; this would
    allow specifying expectations that are dependent on locale or Windows Active Code
    Page (ACP).
  - Charles expressed support for that approach.
  - PBrett asked what the advantage of an attribute would be.
  - Victor replied that it could be added to existing functions without ABI impact.
  - Charles observed that, if the `#embed` proposal is adopted, then text that is not
    in the literal encoding might be imported.
  - Hubert responded that the `#embed` author has been clear that the proposal is intended
    to provide binary resources.
  - Tom changed topics by asking for suggestions regarding how to solicit new SG16 attendees
    and reported that he and Peter had previously discussed inviting other WG21 members to
    share what the organizations they work with do in practice.
  - PBrett responded that backward compatibility and existing practice are motivation for
    not providing new facilities.
  - PBrett suggested that, if someone were to come forward with a proposal to adopt a suite
    of string types similar to those provided by Rust, that we might tell them no thank you.
  - PBrett stated that we should, of course, discuss any proposals that come before us.
  - Tom replied that seems to argue for the status quo plus what people actually do.
  - Jens expressed belief that there is good opportunity to make progress with small
    improvements and provided a UTF-8 decoding iterator as an example.
  - Tom replied that an existing proposal covers such iterators.
  - \[ Editor's note: See
    [P0244 (Text_view: A C++ concepts and range based character encoding and code point enumeration library)](https://wg21.link/p0244). \]
  - Charles responded that he has written a grapheme iterator.
  - Charles noted that such iterators are always going to be slower than bulk conversion routines.
  - PBrett suggested adding locale-independent replacements for character classification
    functions like `isdigit()`; e.g., `is_ascii_digit()`.
  - Charles expressed support for such locale invariant functions and noted via chat that glib
    provides such a variant named `g_ascii_isdigit()`.
  - Tom noted that there is a distinction; locale-independent variants would operate using an
    implementation-defined encoding where as ASCII variants would operate using ASCII even in
    an EBCDIC environment.
  - Hubert asked if anyone would object to having both variants; e.g., a locale-independent
    variant that always operates using the "C" locale and an ASCII variant.
  - No objections were raised.
  - PBrett stated that the highest priority item should be transcoding facilities.
  - Jens asked if he meant something like `iconv()`.
  - PBrett responded that he meant something more like JeanHeyd Meneide's `ztd::text`.
  - \[ Editor's note: JeanHeyd's `ztd::text` work is published
    [here](https://ztdtext.readthedocs.io/en/latest). \]
  - Charles stated that, with regard to providing an ICU interface in the standard, there are
    performance implications; support for generic iterators would warrant availability of
    definitions for inlining purposes.
  - PBrett asked if anyone could comment regarding the utility of `std::message`.
  - Steve responded that the main problem with message catalogs is that they don't tend to work
    well with real languages.
  - PBrett reported having good experience with GNU gettext, but that it required discipline to
    be used successfully.
  - PBrett stated that the other elephant in the room is locale, but noted that `std::format()`
    provides a foundation we can build on.
  - Tom suggested the possibility of enabling thread-specific locale facilities that avoid reliance
    on a global locale.
  - PBrett suggested a review of all locale dependent interfaces followed by a proposal that adds
    variants that accept a locale as an argument.
  - Jens replied that C already does that and that all C++ interfaces use `std::locale`.
  - Hubert stated that POSIX provides a thread aware locale interface that enables changing locale
    for a specific thread as well as interfaces that accept a locale argument.
  - PBrett provided an example; a `std::isalpha()` overload that accepts a `std::locale` argument.
  - Hubert responded that POSIX specifies a `isalpha_l()` interface that accepts a `locale_t` argument.
  - Tom asked if `std::locale` is fundamentally problematic or whether the problems we face with it
    are isolated to the facets.
  - PBrett responded that it has fundamental limitations due to reliance on inheritance.
  - Victor stated that the facet's assumption that characters fit in a code unit is the most
    significant problem.
  - Victor added that `std::locale` uses reference counting and therefore has a performance profile
    similar to a shared pointer.
  - Hubert stated that `std::locale` strongly ties C++ implementations to the suite of C locales
    since the interface depends on the names of C locales; it is therefore questionable how
    implementors might provide more generic locale support.
  - Steve stated that WG14 recently adopted a proposal that adds '@', '$', and '`' to the basic
    source character set.
  - Steve added that he intends to bring a matching paper to WG21 in the near future.
  - \[ Editor's note: The adopted WG14 proposal is
    [N2701](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2701.htm). \]
- Tom announced that the next meeting will be on March 9th and, unless a new paper materializes,
  will likely focus on diving deeper into one of the topics discussed today.


# February 9th, 2022

## Agenda
- [P2498R1: Forward compatibility of text_encoding with additional encoding registries](https://wg21.link/p2498r1)
  - Continue prior discussion and poll.
- [D2513R1: char8_t Compatibility and Portability Fixes](https://wg21.link/p2513r1)
  - Initial review.

## Meeting summary
- Attendees:
  - Charlie Barto
  - Hubert Tong
  - JeanHeyd Meneide
  - Jens Maurer
  - Peter Brett
  - Steve Downey
  - Tom Honermann
  - Victor Zverovich
- [P2498R1: Forward compatibility of text_encoding with additional encoding registries](https://wg21.link/p2498r1)
  - PBrett presented:
    - The R0 revision was reviewed by SG16 a few weeks ago.
    - The R1 revision rebases the wording on the latest P1885 revision.
    - The wording was reworked to decouple IANA IDs from the exposition only data members.
  - Victor noticed an unnecessary trailing semicolon following the closing brace of the
    `std` namespace declaration in the proposed updates to \[text.encoding\].
  - Hubert noted that Corentin's recently added response to P2498R1 in
    [P1885R10](https://wg21.link/p1885r10)
    noted unnecessary use of an enum for the proposed internal details of the `text_encoding`
    class and asked if it was necessary for it to be an enum.
  - PBrett responded that it is exposition only.
  - Jens pointed out an existing `using enum id` declaration in the `text_encoding` synopsis
    that should presumably have been changed to `using enum iana_id`.
  - Jens noted similar renaming updates needed in the postcondition for the
    `text_encoding(iana_id)` constructor where comparisons against `id::unknown` and
    `id::other` are currently present.
  - Jens observed that the `text_encoding(iana_id)` constructor does not state that
    its argument is stored.
  - PBrett explained that such storage is implied by the postcondition requirements on
    the result of calls to `iana_mib()`.
  - Jens suggested that there should be some wording that relates the exposition only `id`
    type to `iana_id`.
  - PBrett agreed that could be better specified.
  - PBrett indicated that some positive guidance is needed before spending further effort on
    this proposal.
  - Tom suggested polling support for the concerns the paper purports to address.
  - Discussion regarding polls ensued.
  - **Poll 1A: It should be more explicit in the identifiers used by the `text_encoding`
    interface that the facility is tied to the IANA character sets database.**
    - Attendance: 8

      | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
      |   2 |   3 |   1 |   2 |   0 |

    - Weak consensus in favor.
  - **Poll 1B: The `text_encoding` class design should be modified to facilitate potential
    future association with additional encoding registries without retaining a bias towards
    the IANA registry.**
    - Attendance: 8 (one abstention)

      | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
      |   1 |   3 |   2 |   0 |   1 |

    - No consensus.
    - SA: I think IANA is a reasonable default and others can be added; we shouldn't slow
      down progress.
  - **Poll 1C: The `text_encoding` class should be renamed to `iana_text_encoding`.**
    - Attendance: 8

    - No consensus.
  - **Poll 1D: Address feedback on wording in P2498R1 "Forward compatibility of text_encoding
    with additional encoding registries", and forward the paper as revised to LEWG as a bug
    fix for P1885 "Naming text encodings to demystify them" with a recommended ship vehicle
    of C++23.**
    - Attendance: 8 (one abstention)

      | SF  | F   | N   | A   | SA  |
      | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
      |   1 |   4 |   0 |   2 |   0 |
    - Weak consensus in favor.
  - Jens requested that the changes regarding exposition only data members be removed if the
    intent is just to rename some identifiers as opposed to changing the original design intent.
- [D2513R1: char8_t Compatibility and Portability Fixes](https://wg21.link/p2513r1)
  - \[ Editor's note: D2513R1 was the active paper under discussion at the telecon. The agenda
    and links used here reference P2513R1 since the links to the draft paper were ephemeral.
    The published document may differ from the reviewed draft revision. \]
  - JeanHeyd presented:
    - The `char8_t` related changes in C++20 made it more difficult to write code that works
      in both C and C++.
    - The proposal is intended to improve compatibility with C.
    - The proposal provides an escape hatch in C++ to restore some uses of UTF-8 string literals
      with `char`, `signed char`, and `unsigned char`.
    - The proposal only relaxes array initialization; pointer behavior is not changed.
    - The changes are intended as a DR against C++20 so that common code can be written for
      C++17, C++20, C++23, and C.
  - Victor stated that relaxing initialization for arrays but not for pointers creates an
    inconsistency and that he prefers an error.
  - Victor added that `signed char` and `unsigned char` are commonly used for `int8_t` and
    `uint8_t` and the proposed changes would allow arrays of these types to now be initialized
    by UTF-8 string literals.
  - JeanHeyd acknowledged this would be the case and is consistent with C++11 through C++17.
  - Hubert presented a backward compatibilty concern involving overload resolution and
    initialization of parameters of aggregate type using list initialization syntax; the
    following example is well-formed in C++20, but would become ill-formed with the proposed
    change.

        struct A { char8_t s[5]; };
        struct B { char s[5]; };
        void f(A);
        void f(B);
        void foo() {
          f({u8"text"}); // Resolves to f(A) in C++20, ambiguous with the proposed changes.
        }

  - PBrett observed that the overload resolution issue currently exists with `signed char`
    and `unsigned char`.
  - Tom asked for confirmation that binding to a reference to an array would still be
    ill-formed.
  - JeanHeyd replied affirmatively.
  - Jens explained that there is an existing special case that permits initialization of
    arrays of `signed char` or `unsigned char` by an ordinary string literal.
  - PBrett summarized; the overload scenario already exists for `char`, `signed char`,
    and `unsigned char`.
  - Jens agreed and suggested adding an annex C entry with the above example to note the
    new ambiguity.
  - JeanHeyd reviewed the wording.
    - The value of the `__cpp_char8_t` feature test macro is updated.
    - The subsitution of "may" for "can" in \[dcl.init.string\] is a drive by fix done
      to maintain consistency with the other changes to the paragraph.
  - JeanHeyd noted that, with the changes, a program that passes a UTF-8 string literal
    as an argument for a function parameter of type `const char*` remains ill-formed.
  - JeanHeyd stated that the ability to initialize `char`-based arrays with a UTF-8
    string literal addresses constexpr concerns in a much simpler way than is presented
    in [P1423R3 (char8_t backward compatibility remediation)](https://wg21.link/p1423r3).
  - PBrett asked if any consideration was given for addressing these concerns with a
    core issue.
  - JeanHeyd replied that a core issue wouldn't be appropriate since the C++20 changes
    were deliberate.
  - Tom agreed and noted that this aspect of the C++20 changes was approved by EWG.
  - Jens agreed that a core issue is unlikely to be helpful, especially since a paper
    already exists.
  - Jens asserted that EWG should review and, as a DR, this can be considered after
    C++23 feature freeze.
  - Hubert observed that the backward compatibility impact to overload resolution can
    be avoided by limiting the allowance to variables of array type.
  - Jens agreed, but noted that would require more careful wordsmithing.
  - **Poll 2: Add an Annex C entry and discussion to D2513R1, and forward the published
    paper as revised to EWG as a defect report.**
    - Attendance: 8 (one abstention)

      | SF  | F   | N   | A   | SA  |
      | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
      |   1 |   5 |   0 |   1 |   0 |
    - Strong consensus in favor.
    - A: Concerned about the different handling for pointers vs arrays; concerns
      increased as discussion continued.
  - Tom asked if anyone felt concern about the possibility of unintended initialization
    by a UTF-8 string literal as opposed to an ordinary string literal.
  - Victor expressed minor concern, but that the risk is low.
  - JeanHeyd noted that such unintended possibilities are already the case in C.
- Tom announced that the next telecon will be February 23rd.


# January 26th, 2022

## Agenda
- [P2286R6: Formatting Ranges](https://wg21.link/p2286r6)
  - Review proposed wording for new SG16 concerns and consistency with prior guidance.

## Meeting summary
- Attendees:
  - Charlie Barto
  - Hubert Tong
  - Jens Maurer
  - Mark de Wever
  - Peter Brett
  - Steve Downey
  - Tom Honermann
  - Victor Zverovich
  - Zach Laine
- Tom informed the group of tentative plans for a SSRG and SG16 joint telecon to discuss the
  security aspects of
  [P2528R0 (C++ Identifier Security using Unicode Standard Annex 39)](https://wg21.link/p2528r0)
  and asked for feedback or concerns about such a meeting.
- [P2286R6: Formatting Ranges](https://wg21.link/p2286r6):
  - Tom informed the group that Barry was unable to be in attendance but that we are ok to
    discuss the wording and gather feedback for him.
  - Victor explained that he had assisted with the wording related to escape handling, but that
    Barry authored the rest.
  - Jens stated that it is generally not advised to discuss a paper without the author present.
  - Tom acknowledged the guidance and reported that he had communicated with Barry and that Barry
    was content with Victor being present to discuss any issues that are raised.
  - Jens asked for confirmation that LEWG has already approved the design.
  - Victor responded that the paper is present in the currently active electronic polling cycle.
  - Victor shared the paper and reviewed the revision history.
  - Victor began reviewing the wording.
  - PBrett asked if the `formattable` concept has semantic constraints that cannot be expressed
    in the concept definition.
  - Victor replied that it does not.
  - Jens noted that, in section 5.1 of the paper, \[format.formattable\] paragraph 2 states the
    semantic requirements.
  - Zach asked if the concept has been implemented as specified.
  - Victor expressed uncertainty regarding the concept definition, but assured the group that the
    rest of the design has been implemented.
  - Mark asked, with regard to section 5.2, why '?' appears as a type.
  - Victor explained a requirement for mutual exclusivity.
  - PBrett asked if there is intent to standardize the use of '?' to enable a debug representation
    generally; e.g., for non-standard types.
  - Victor replied that doing so is outside the scope of the standard, but expressed support for
    that direction.
  - PBrett noted that the paper introduces a `set_debug_format()` member function and asked if it
    would be desirable to add generic support for invoking it.
  - Jens replied that the parser for the formatted type would presumably have to be responsible for
    recognizing the '?' character and invoking the member function.
  - Jens noted that calls to `set_debug_format()` must activate the debug format regardless of
    whether a '?' is present in the format string.
  - Jens suggested that adding generic facilities to support the '?' specifier would be ok, but
    probably best addressed by a different paper.
  - Hubert noted that, in the proposed wording for \[format.string.escaped\], subparagraph 2.4.1,
    that the "Other" ("C") value of `General_Category` is an abbreviation for a set of categories
    and requested that the wording specify the individual categories.
  - \[ Editor's note: The values for `General_Category` are specified in
    [table 12 of section 5.7.1 of Unicode 14 UAX#44](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/tr44-28.html#General_Category_Values). \]
  - \[ Editor's note: The wording also refers to the `General_Category` value of "Separator" ("Z")
    that is likewise an abbreviation for a set of categories and should presumably be expanded
    as well. \]
  - Hubert noted that format stability cannot be guaranteed and that output will change when
    newer Unicode standards are adopted.
  - Tom asked for confirmation that stability will only be lacking for currently unassigned characters.
  - Steve replied that this should be further researched and noted that the "Unassigned" ("Cn")
    property is not stable.
  - Hubert noted that the wording does not address non-Unicode text and asked if `isprint()` and
    `iswprint()` should be used to identify non-printable characters in those cases.
  - Jens replied that doing so warrants further discussion.
  - Hubert pondered whether it would be preferable to map non-Unicode characters to Unicode and then
    proceed with using the Unicode character properties.
  - Tom noted that, for implementations that support user defined encodings, the implementation may
    not know how to map to Unicode.
  - Hubert noted that such user defined definitions must define categories to be used for `isprint()`
    and other character classification functions, but acknowledged that a mapping to Unicode may not
    be present.
  - PBrett stated that \[format.string.escaped\] paragraph 2 does not state how to determine if the
    string to be escaped is in a Unicode encoding.
  - PBrett noted that he believes such wording to be present in the wording related to field width
    and suggested it may be desirable to generalize that and move it to a central location.
  - Steve asked if the determination might be locale dependent.
  - PBrett noted that previous guidance was that `std::format()` may be used for binary data and that
    any associated encoding is therefore tenuous.
  - Jens suggested that, in those cases, a programmer might be advised not to use the '?' formatting
    type.
  - Tom suggested it may be reasonable to, again, use the literal encoding as a proxy for the
    potentially locale dependent encoding.
  - Victor agreed.
  - Hubert stated that, for the non-Unicode case, determining printability would require either locale
    dependence or preservation of the compile-time literal encoding.
  - Charlie noted that, historically, the latter would have been difficult and that, for Microsoft,
    the active code page (ACP) was used in the past.
  - Hubert noted that, in a cross-compilation scenario, it is possible that the literal encoding is
    not a defined encoding for the target environment.
  - Tom suggested that, at some point, we will need to poll whether the non-Unicode behavior should
    be locale dependent or not.
  - Hubert expressed acceptance of non-locale dependent behavior for the non-Unicode case so long as
    there is no requirement to match the behavior for the Unicode case with regard to emitting hex
    vs UCN notation.  
  - Hubert noted that, if locale dependence is avoided, it will be necessary to assume an
    encoding for characters that are not consistently encoded for all locales; like '\\' in EBCDIC
    environments.
  - Hubert added that doing so might be ok if the choice is determined by the literal encoding.
  - PBrett suggested it may be useful to support opt-in to locale dependence via the 'L' modifier.
  - Victor stated that the 'L' modifier could be reserved for now.
  - Mark noted that the 'L' modifier is currently supported for character type.
  - Jens pointed out that the changes to \[format.formatter.spec\] paragraph 2 appear to indicate
    that a declaration of the `set_debug_format()` member function in any one of the specializations
    will affect all of them.
  - Victor agreed that this wording requires more work.
  - Mark asked when a formatter object for which `set_debug_format()` was called is reset or what
    happens when the '?' specifier is not applicable to the type.
  - Victor replied that it should be an error to specify mutually exclusive options or that the last
    option overrides prior ones but that further consideration is required.
  - Jens stated that the order of the interior bullets in \[format.string.escaped\] subparagraph
    2.2 need to be revised to address two issues:
    1) The algorithm must process the contents of string `S` in order.
    2) `S` consists of a sequence of code units, not UCS scalar values.
  - Jens suggested trying to factor out the code unit and UCS scalar value cases to avoid the
    exceptions.
  - Charlie stated that the handling of invalid code unit sequences needs to be specified since
    recovery may not always be possible; failure to recover could result in output containing a long
    sequence of values in hex notation.
  - Jens acknowledged the scenario and agreed that the specification must be made clear about that.
  - Jens asked what "universal character name escape sequence" is intended to mean in
    \[format.string.escaped\] subparagraph 2.4.2 and noted that a definition does not exist for
    "universal character name" though one does exist for *universal-character-name*.
  - Jens noted that this wording probably should not refer to *universal-character-name* since it
    describes a grammar nonterminal and suggested replacing "its universal character name escape sequence"
    with "a sequence of scalar values".
  - PBrett agreed.
  - Steve pointed out that similar uses of grammar nonterminals appear in the wording.
  - Jens agreed and suggested that the various "escape sequence" uses should be replaced with
    "a sequence of scalar values in the form ...".
  - Jens pointed out a grammar issue in the first line of \[format.string.escaped]\ paragraph 3;
    "... is equivalent to the escaped string representation a string of `C` ...".
  - Hubert requested that a note be added to \[format.string.escaped\] paragraph 4 to indicate that
    behavior is not locale dependent but that the encoding may be informed by the literal encoding.
  - Jens reported that the expected output noted in the comment for example `s3` in
    \[format.string.escaped\] paragraph 4 is incorrect; there should be two ranges and therefore two
    sets of brackets.
  - Tom observed that the examples that follow \[format.string.escaped\] paragraph 4 depict the
    expected Unicode behavior, but appear to be part of paragraph 4 which is specific to non-Unicode
    behavior.
  - Victor agreed there is a presentation issue that needs to be addressed there.
  - Jens advised moving paragraphs 2 through 6 of \[format.range\] after the `range_formatter` class
    definition.
  - Victor noted that "exposition only" should appear in italics.
  - Mark asked why, in the last row of the table associated with \[format.range\] paragraph 6, "?s"
    is required as opposed to just "?".
  - PBrett stated that requiring "?s" is inconsistent with the string case where "?" can be specified
    by itself.
  - Victor explained that "s" indicates that a range is intended to be formatted as a string; "?s" is
    therefore needed to format the range as a string in debug mode.
  - PBrett pointed out the "this is equivalent to invoking set_brackets({}, {})" note in \[format.range\]
    paragraph 5 and asked if a programmer is permitted to make such a call.
  - Victor replied that the wording is intended for implementors.
  - PBrett asked if, when implementing a range formatter, whether it is required to implement member
    functions like `set_brackets()`.
  - Victor replied that LEWG had discussed this and that the member functions are intended to help
    avoid ABI issues.
  - Mark asked if `set_separator()` and `set_brackets()` should be restricted to characters and how
    characters outside the basic character set need to be handled in various scenarios such as
    applicability to estimated field width determination.
  - Victor replied that the functions accept strings as input.
  - Tom reviewed the list of previously discussed design points that were noted in the
    [email announcing the agenda for the telecon](https://lists.isocpp.org/sg16/2022/01/2956.php).
  - Tom noted the need for wording to address recovery from encoding errors.
  - Charlie stated that recovery should follow the processes described in the
    [WHATWG Encoding Standard](https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org).
  - \[ Editor's note: See
    [section 4.1, "Encoders and decoders"](https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#encoders-and-decoders). \]
  - Tom noted the need to ensure that `std::filesystem::path` is rejected as a formattable range.
  - Victor replied that it is rejected by the constraints on the `formatter` partial specialization
    specified in the \[format.syn\] updates; those constraints reject recursive ranges.
  - Victor suggested it might be helpful to add a note that `std::filesystem::path` is rejected there.
- Tom announced that the next telecon will be February 9th.


# January 12th, 2022

## Agenda
- [P2491R0: Text encodings follow-up](https://wg21.link/p2491r0)
  - Initial review.
- [P2498R0: Forward compatibility of text_encoding with additional encoding registries](https://wg21.link/p2498r0)
  - Initial review.

## Meeting summary
- Attendees:
  - Hubert Tong
  - Jens Maurer
  - Peter Brett
  - Steve Downey
  - Tom Honermann
  - Victor Zverovich
- \[ Editor's note: We did not have quorum due to low attendance; as a result, no polls were taken. \]
- \[ Editor's note: Changes made in a draft of
     [P1885R9](https://wg21.link/p1885r9)
     were material to review of the papers on the agenda, so we first reviewed it. \]
- [P1885R9: Naming Text Encodings to Demystify Them](https://wg21.link/p1885r9)
  - Jens stated that there is a procedural question related to the changes made in this revision; the
    new draft changes the design after electronic polling.
  - Tom replied that the changes were at least partially inspired by comments received on the proposal
    by electronic polling participants and were intended to increase consensus.
  - PBrett noted that the polled revision did not have the wording to mandate `CHAR_BIT == 8` due to a
    procedural error and asked whether that warranted follow up with LEWG.
  - PBrett asked what it means in practice for the wording to mandate `CHAR_BIT == 8`.
  - Jens replied that it requires a call to a function specified with that wording to be ill-formed if
    the requirement is violated.
  - Jens explained that implementors can conform with this requirement by defining such functions as
    deleted, implementing them as a function template with an appropriate `static_assert`, or similar.
  - PBrett asked for more details regarding implementation as a function template and whether the
    functions could simply not be declared at all.
  - Tom replied that a function template is ok because taking the address of a standard library function
    is not allowed; the standard just requires a call expression to be well-formed.
  - Hubert explained that the name must be declared due to interaction with name lookup.
  - Jens stated an implementation preference to define the function as deleted.
  - PBrett: noticed that the revision history simply stated "Wording fixes" with no details.
  - Tom volunteered to review the R8 and R9 revisions and to summarize the differences in the meeting
    summary.
  - \[ Editor's note: Tom did so; the wording differences identified include:
      - An additional `using enum id` declaration was added to the definition of `text_encoding`.
      - The `wide_literal()`, `wide_environment()`, and `wide_environment_is()` declarations were
        removed and wording that referred to them adjusted accordingly.
      - "character encoding" was changed to "character encoding scheme" in the paragraph following
        the note regarding how the names of `text_encoding::id` enumerators were derived from the
        IANA registry.
      - A paragraph describing invariants maintained by `text_encoding` was added.
      - Wording that introduced and used `SUBSTITUTE_UTF_ENCODING()` for mapping the bigendian and
        littleendian UTF-16 and UTF-32 schemes to their respective encoding forms was removed;
        related wording was adjusted accordingly.
      - Wording to mandate `CHAR_BIT == 8` was added throughout.

    \]
- [P2491R0: Text encodings follow-up](https://wg21.link/p2491r0)
  - Jens summarized the paper.
  - Jens stated that the changes in P1885R9 improve consistency with the IANA intent and P1885 usage.
  - Jens added that there is opportunity for specification improvements, but that they can be
    addressed during LWG review.
  - Tom noted that the wording plan described in the paper indicated intent to remove the
    requirement that `CHAR_BIT == 8`.
  - Jens confirmed, but expressed a lack of concern; that restriction can be removed if motivation
    to do so arises.
  - PBrett expressed a preference for explicit specification for how IANA octets are mapped to
    C++ code units.
  - Jens agreed, stated that can be done during LWG review, and expressed a preference for a
    normative sentence that maps an IANA octet to a `char` code unit.
  - Jens expressed a belief that relying on IANA for anything other than octets would be a mistake.
  - PBrett asked if Jens had an alternative to suggest.
  - Jens replied that he did not, but that such concerns usually arose during discussion of UTF-16
    and UTF-32.
  - Hubert stated that mapping to IANA in those cases is feasible, but noted that there are
    multiple possible mappings that may be platform dependent; particularly when the size of
    `char` is not 8 bits.
  - PBrett agreed, but noted that a particular mapping could be required for a conforming
    implementation.
  - Tom added that a non-conforming implementation would map to "other" in that case.
- [P2498R0: Forward compatibility of text_encoding with additional encoding registries](https://wg21.link/p2498r0)
  - PBrett introduced the proposal:
    - Character encoding repositories other than IANA exist.
    - The mapping to IANA should be explicit such that a mapping to another registry could be
      gracefully introduced in the future if motivation arises.
  - PBrett summarized the proposed changes:
    - Rename "id" to "iana_id"
    - Rename "mib" to "iana_mib"
    - Add recommended practice to avoid implementations creating an over dependence on IANA.
  - PBrett asked for opinions on the proposed renames.
  - Victor asked if other viable candidate registries exist in practice and stated that, if not,
    the proposed renames seem premature.
  - PBrett replied that there are NB concerns about IANA being an unregulated, unaccountable,
    and unreliable organization.
  - PBrett added that examples of other registries can be found in
    the [WhatWG Encoding Standard](https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org),
    IBM's [Character Data Representation Architecture (CDRA)](https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/G01BQVRV),
    and [ISO/IEC 2022:1994](https://www.iso.org/standard/22747.html).
  - PBrett noted that the paper does not propose the addition of another registry; just the
    possibility to add more in the future in a seamless manner.
  - Jens suggested adding examples of other registries to the paper.
  - PBrett responded with concern that doing so might create disruption for the advancement of
    P1885 and result in considerable time spent debating whether the merits of each such
    repository warrant their being mentioned.
  - Steve asked for confirmation that, assuming an additional registry, that a single text
    encoding ID is still needed.
  - PBrett responded that the IANA ID is an enum class and that, in principle, multiple such
    classes are possible.
  - Steve stated that renaming `mib()` to `iana_mib()` results in the feature no longer being generic.
  - Jens agreed.
  - PBrett responded that code written for P1885 today that consults `mib()` is necessarily concerned
    with IANA specifically.
  - Steve asked what function a generic library should call then.
  - Jens replied that, if the IANA ID is desired, then call `mib()`.
  - Tom noted that, since multiple encodings may map to IANA's "other", reliance on `mib()` to uniquely
    identify an encoding is not possible.
  - Hubert opined that the proposed renames are fine, but that extension to other registries might
    require different terminology.
  - Jens offered examples such as "unique ID" and "UUID".
  - Jens opined that it doesn't hurt to add "iana" to make the terminology association explicit.
  - Hubert agreed.
  - Hubert stated that, for wide encodings, there are some registries that are somewhat suitable;
    in CDRA, wide encodings aren't explicitly represented as they constitute a composition of a
    character set and an encoding.
  - PBrett acknowledged and noted that the proposal is intended to clear design space for extension
    for such cases.
  - Tom provided some arguments in favor of support for multiple registries:
    - As previously noted, the IANA specification is goverened by an organization that some have
      concerns about.
    - The IANA registry is poor from a quality of specification perspective.
    - The IANA registry is missing entries that are found in other registries.
    - The same name is sometimes used by different registries to refer to differenc encodings.
    - Other registries are arguably more suitable for some environments; e.g., CDRA for IBM
      environments.
  - Tom suggested that the proposal replace the P1885 proposed exposition only data members with
    post conditions on the default constructor to require `iana_mib()` and `name()` to return
    `id::other` and an empty string respectively; this is to avoid encouraging implementations to
    simply store an IANA ID.
  - PBrett noted that much of the current wording is in terms of the `mib_` exposition only data
    member.
  - Tom replied that those can be changed to `mib()`.
  - Jens pointed out that the following text from the proposed wording creates the impression that
    the specified feature provides a remote API interface.
    - "\[text.encoding\] describes an interface for accessing the IANA Character Sets registry".
  - Jens stated that `text_encoding` currently containes a list of all encodings in the IANA
    registry and that this proposal makes the `text_encoding` class more of a first class entity
    for which mapping to other registries is ancillary functionality.
  - Jens opined that this direction suggests the need to create our own encoding registry since the
    functionality effectively defines one.
  - Jens stated that such a change constitutes a change in direction that is more significant than
    the proposed renames suggest.
  - PBrett acknowledged that the proposal makes the design more abstract in a manner similar to how
    Unicode specifies abstract characters.
  - PBrett added that he could imagine a C++ appendix that lists the encodings, but that would then
    necessitate defining them.
  - Jens stated that a registration service could be established, but did not advise doing so.
  - Jens observed that discussion has not yet reached the bottom of how encodings would be mapped
    between encodings registered with different registries.
  - Jens suggested the possibility of defining an `iana_text_encoding` class and later adding an
    `iso_text_encoding` class or similar for other registries if warranted.
  - Hubert observed that the P1885 design contains the same mapping problem since it presents a
    single domain, but doesn't adhere solely to that domain.
  - Hubert suggested the possibility of a `text_encoding` class template parameterized by a
    registry identifier.
  - Tom noted that, if one were to map the encodings present in the
    [ICU converter explorer](https://icu4c-demos.unicode.org/icu-bin/convexp),
    then parameterization by registry is necessary due to conflicting use of the same name for
    different encodings.
  - \[ Editor's note: For example, "korean" maps to "windows-949-2000" via the "Windows"
    provider, but to "ibm-1363_P11B-1998" via the "IANA" provider. \]
  - PBrett reiterated the intent of this proposal; to remove complete dependency on IANA.
  - Tom stated that the proposed change is consistent with the P1885 direction given that comparison
    is dependent on name when an encoding maps to IANA's "other".
  - Tom opined that there is no need to specify a mapping between repositories in the standard;
    the mapping can be implementation-defined.
  - Jens agreed that leaving the mapping implementation-defined is possible but felt an obligation
    to specify the mapping.
  - Hubert noted that, for implementors, the concern is what is in the interest of their users.
  - PBrett expressed a belief that creation of a character encoding registry service would be outside
    the scope of WG21 work, but that he would be willing to assist with such an effort outside of WG21.
  - Jens agreed and noted that such a service would essentially be attending to graves.
  - Hubert suggested that `text_encoding` may be more appropriate as a concept.
  - Tom stated that distinct classes or class template specializations for each registry would create
    friction at interface boundaries.
  - Hubert responded that a type erased interface could still be specified.
  - PBrett expressed being open to other suggestions.
  - Jens suggested renaming the current `text_encoding` class to `iana_text_encoding` and, if
    motivation arises for another registry, then a new class can be added.
  - General discussion ensued regarding the ramification of distinct classes.
  - Tom pondered what name would be returned by `name()` if multiple registries are supported.
  - PBrett responded that his proposal intended to avoid that question.
- Tom stated that the next telecon will be held on 2022-01-26 and that the agenda will include:
  - [P2286R5 (formatting ranges)](https://wg21.link/p2286r5),
  - the LWG issues concerning `std::format` fill characters, and/or
  - a new revision of
